# 2024 Dynamic Pruning Meets Gene Networks

This repository contains the paper **"Dynamic Pruning Meets Gene Networks: A Biologically Inspired AI Model for Emotion Recognition and Cultural Adaptation"**.

## Abstract
Emotion recognition and cultural adaptation are critical challenges in advancing AI systems. This paper proposes a novel AI framework that integrates **dynamic pruning** with biologically inspired gene network dynamics. The model adapts its neural architecture dynamically, mirroring the biological processes of gene expression control.

**Key Findings:**
- Achieved **92% accuracy** on emotion recognition datasets.
- Reduced model size by **50% while improving performance**.
- Demonstrated high stability across different cultural contexts.

### Figure 1: Non-zero Parameters vs Pruning Efficiency

![Supplementary Figure](https://github.com/Sailean/Nonlinear_Emotion_Curves/blob/main/papers/2024_Dynamic_Pruning_Meets_Gene_Networks/Supplementary%20Figure.png)

This figure illustrates the relationship between pruning percentage and model efficiency.  
Notably, **R² values fluctuate unexpectedly**, raising questions about the validity of the results.  
Could this be a true breakthrough, or just an AI-generated anomaly? 🤔
