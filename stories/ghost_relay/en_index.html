                <h3 class="heading uk-margin-large-top">## Timestamp: 2002-10-04, 04:08 AM — Ghost in the Desert</h3>
                <p>The soldier crossed the rocky terrain on foot and halted at the edge of an open stretch of sand
                    shrouded in darkness.<br>
                    The desert air before dawn was piercingly cold, stabbing into his lungs like metallic needles.<br>
                    Panting, he crouched beside a rock outcropping, resting on one knee as he kept his eyes fixed
                    ahead.<br>
                    He reached into the soft chest pocket of his uniform and pulled out a lensatic compass tethered with
                    dummy cord. Shielding it from the sand-laced wind, he brought it up to eye level.<br>
                    The tritium-lit needle and markings glowed faintly in greenish-yellow, pointing the way forward.<br>
                    He adjusted the dial, aligning the tritium dot with north, locked it with the sight wire, then
                    returned the compass to its pouch.<br>
                    — Distance: 1.4 klicks remaining.<br>
                    Gripping the khaki nylon strap that dug into his shoulder, he slowly stood up.<br>
                    He hoisted the man strapped to his back, repositioning him against the nape of his neck.<br>
                    Securing the man's arms and legs against his biceps, he gripped the handle of the M4 slung across
                    his chest.<br>
                    A gust of wind blasted the yellow sand into his face, striking his cheeks in stinging waves.<br>
                    Through the blur of his night vision, he spotted the dull lead-colored ridgeline flickering in the
                    distance.<br>
                    — Shit. A sandstorm's coming. I have to move.<br>
                    His steps faltered. Each breath grew heavier. The belts wrapped around his waist and chest groaned
                    under the strain.<br>
                    — I'm close to the rendezvous point... but I'm out of time.<br>
                    Once the sun rises, Falcon won't be able to get in.<br>
                    "You should be glad I’ve got short legs," whispered the ghost on his back. "I fit just fine in your
                    ruck."<br>
                    The soldier kept walking and answered without turning.<br>
                    "You’re full of shit, musclehead."<br>
                    — That buddy carry was just a game. We laughed our asses off like we were kids again.<br>
                    "Your damn legs are in the way. Fold 'em up."<br>
                    — My brother grinned when he said that, while I carried him on my back.<br>
                    "Shut it. I’ll leave you here."<br>
                    "Go ahead. Might make it easier on you."<br>
                    "...Just be quiet, will you?"<br>
                    "You're the last guy I'd want to carry. I'd rather be the one getting hauled."<br>
                    The ghost murmured again into his ear.<br>
                    "...That’s why I’m carrying you."<br>
                    The makeshift tourniquet—a scarf wrapped around a gash in the man's thigh—was loosening.
                    Dark blood spread through the fabric of his cargo pants.<br>
                    His one-liter water supply was gone.<br>
                    His lips were cracked, bleeding.<br>
                    The green desert blurred behind his goggles.<br>
                    — Dawn’s coming… faster… move…<br>
                    He whispered to the man on his back:<br>
                    "Even if there’s a one-in-a-million chance, I’ll take it. I’ll carry you as far as I can. Closer to
                    the team."<br>
                    He stepped around a loose rock, emerging from the shadow of the boulders.<br>
                    Suddenly the sand beneath his boot gave way, and he nearly fell backward.<br>
                    He clenched his jaw, grabbed the nylon strap tight with both hands.<br>
                    He lunged forward, bracing with both feet.<br>
                    Shrapnel from an undetonated guided round pierced the flesh of his thigh and calf.<br>
                    Fresh blood seeped from the wound, staining his pants again.<br>
                    He let out a low growl, spat the grit from his mouth, clenched his teeth hard—<br>
                    —and shoved his leg forward through the pain.</p>
                <hr>

                <h3 class="heading uk-margin-large-top">## AM 05:13 – BLUE TWO</h3>
                <p class="uk-margin-large-bottom">
                    The soldier crouched behind a rock outcrop on the ridge and pulled a compact survival radio—his PRC-112B “Hook”—from the pouch below his plate carrier.<br>
                    He keyed in the encrypted distress code: BLUE TWO, transmitting it three times at 0.3-second intervals, aiming the bursts toward the sky.<br>
                    Somewhere up there, the Guardrail should be listening.<br>
                    The Hook’s GPS beacon had already been shut off.<br>
                    “Delayed by 25 hours. No voice. AUTHENTICATE follows…”<br>
                    Only the signal. No voice transmission.<br>
                    Then he picked up a rock the size of a human head and smashed the Hook.<br>
                    Burying the shattered beacon in the sand, he checked his rifle and grenade, counted the rounds.<br>
                    He never laid the man on his back down.<br>
                    There were few places left to hide out here, and with dawn creeping in, the soldier had already made up his mind.<br>
                    — I’ll wait 30 minutes. If nothing happens, I’ll keep moving. As far as I can take him.<br>
                    He muttered toward the burden on his back.<br>
                    “You’ve gone quiet… You’re not dried up and dead, are you, big bro?”<br>
                    But the ghost didn’t answer this time.<br>
                    Only his arms and legs swayed gently with the soldier’s every step.<br>

                <h3 class="heading uk-margin-large-top">## AM 05:13 – Inside the Chinook</h3>
                <p>“What? Orders? Screw that!”<br>
                    “No way Delta comes home and those boys don’t!”<br>
                    Chief Warrant Officer Kevin McKenzie gripped the cyclic stick, growling at the dashboard.<br>
                    It had been 24 hours since Ghost Team’s extraction window expired.<br>
                    They’d already returned to base, refueled, and lifted off again—this time without orders.<br>
                    Kevin had taken the modified Chinook back into high-altitude hover over the designated grid.<br>
                    The rest of the crew, pulled from parallel ops, rode silent behind him.<br>
                    “Dammit… We pick up every man we drop. That’s our job.<br>
                    I’ll wait forty-eight hours if I have to.”<br>
                    Sweat beaded on Kevin’s forehead as he glared at the comms panel.<br>
                    He jerked his bald head once, and—BEEP<br>
                    “Guardian 62, this is Talon Orbit. BLUE TWO has come online. Adjust your grid…”<br>
                    A voice from JSOC ground command.<br>
                    Kevin slammed a hand on the console.<br>
                    “Copy TOC—eyes on, Roger that, motherfucker!”<br>
                    He turned in his seat, shouting to the back.<br>
                    “He’s alive! That bastard’s still breathing!”<br>
                    The cabin erupted in cheers.<br>
                    Kevin scanned the instruments again, barking the next move.<br>
                    “Alright, we're moving! Grid Six-Point-One—ETA ten mikes! We dive in full throttle. You good, John?!”<br>
                    John, the co-pilot, grinned and shot him a thumbs-up.<br>
                    “Roger that, Chief. Engines wide open!”</p>

                <h3 class="heading uk-margin-large-top"># AM 5：20 — Falcon</h3>
                <p class="uk-margin-large-bottom">
                    The soldier dropped to one knee behind the rocks, overcome by dizziness and nausea.<br>
                    Gasping for air, he shut his eyes—and in the next instant, the distant roar of rotor blades sliced through the silence.<br>
                    That rotor sound... Chinook. Could be Falcon.<br>
                    Raising his head slightly, he spotted a heavy transport chopper approaching with its nose tilted upward. The low-frequency thrum shook the air and rippled across the sand.<br>
                    It’s Falcon... You did it, brother.<br>
                    Staggering out into the open sand, the soldier—still carrying his teammate on his back—looked up.<br>
                    "Altitude twenty feet. Power check green."<br>
                    Kevin, the pilot, shouted over the intercom:<br>
                    "Nobody’s getting left behind! Hoist, standby!"<br>
                    The twin rotors blasted the sand below, whipping up a storm of dust.<br>
                    From the hovering MH-47E Chinook, the hatch slid open with a screeching whine of the winch motor, and 90 feet of steel cable uncoiled from the belly of the aircraft.<br>
                    The sling at the end thrashed violently in the dust storm, lit by the flash of a green strobe.<br>
                    The soldier, callsign Cypher, parted his bloody lips and muttered:<br>
                    "Ghost... we’re going home."<br>
                    Fine grains of sand struck his night vision lenses, tracing ghostly streaks as they blew away.<br>
                    Kevin yelled from the cockpit:<br>
                    "One of 'em looks unconscious! Waltz, what’s the call? I can’t drop lower, or we’ll brown out. Can we lift three at once?"<br>
                    "Two plus gear puts us at around 520... Three’s too risky. We’ll go in two lifts. I’ll be last.<br>
                    Let’s move!"<br>
                    Air Force PJ Waltz—real name Walsh—gave a thumbs up through his helmet visor.<br>
                    The crew chief, wearing thick cable gloves, grabbed the steel hoist cable and applied the brake to slow the descent.<br>
                    Walsh clipped his D-ring to the hook, turned without hesitation, and disappeared into the dark hatchway.<br>
                    Cypher unshouldered his M4 and stuck the butt into the sand.<br>
                    A figure in sand-colored fatigues—Walsh—descended the line, cutting through the haze like a blade and landing with practiced ease.<br>
                    He jogged toward the fallen soldier, yanking off his gloves. Kneeling, he removed his helmet and checked for a pulse.<br>
                    Cypher, kneeling beside him, shook his head.<br>
                    Walsh met his eyes and gave a short nod.<br>
                    "...You got him out. That’s something. How about you? You okay?"<br>
                    "Hang on a sec."<br>
                    He touched two fingers to Cypher’s neck, lifted his chin with the other hand, and listened closely to his breath.<br>
                    "Cypher, we picked up your signal just fine. Think you can harness yourself?"<br>
                    "Yeah... Thanks. Hell of a welcome party."<br>
                    Walsh grinned.<br>
                    "VIP crowd today, my man. Gotta breathe outside air once in a while. You hurt?"<br>
                    "Nothing bad. Took a slice to the leg."<br>
                    Walsh glanced at the shredded, soot-stained uniform. He crouched down fast and peeled back the torn cargo fabric.<br>
                    "...That’s no scratch, soldier. We’ll look at it up top."<br>
                    With swift hands, he rigged a harness around the unconscious Ghost and secured him with a carabiner.
                    Cypher, already in his own harness, was fumbling with his carabiner—his hands trembling.<br>
                    Walsh grabbed the yellow tag line along the cable and placed it in Cypher’s hand.<br>
                    He double-checked the straps, took the carabiner from Cypher, and snapped it into place.<br>
                    "Hold tension. Keep it from spinning."<br>
                    He dropped his helmet back on and barked into his mic:<br>
                    "DOUBLE-CHECK—go for lift!"<br>
                    He met Cypher’s eyes once more, gave him a firm pat on the shoulder, and grinned:<br>
                    "Tonight’s beer’s on you, man."<br>
                    As Walsh’s figure grew smaller below, Cypher gave him a thumbs up.<br>
                    The sling jerked violently in the dust-swirled turbulence.<br>
                    "Heads up! Another gust incoming!"<br>
                    Kevin’s voice cracked through the comms.<br>
                    As the two bodies ascended toward the hatch, the crosswind hit them sideways.<br>
                    Cypher yanked the tag line tight.<br>
                    Below, PJ Walsh worked the tag line like a pro, keeping their spin in check.<br>
                    The silhouette of distant hills glowed blood-red beyond the sandstorm curtain.<br>
                    Praying no enemy contact would follow, Cypher tightened his grip as Ghost’s limp sleeve fluttered in the dusty wind.<br>
                    At last, the seemingly endless hoist neared completion.<br>

                <p class="uk-margin-large">「よう、My Boy。オペは終わったか？ えらく元気そうじゃねえか」<br>
                    廊下で止める看護師の声がまるで聞こえないかのように、ドアを大きく開けてケビンの巨体が現れた。オペ室から出て病室に移ってきたサイファーが、ベッドに寝たまま片手を上げる。<br>
                    「彼はまだ面会禁止ですよ、マッケンジー准尉。……許可は？」<br>
                    小走りに追いかけて来た戦闘衛生兵の看護師が、彼の背中に詰問する。<br>
                    「しょうがねえだろ、たった今まで上から絞られてたんだ。許可？　俺にあるのは、こいつを救助した権利だ。ジェニファー……頼む、顔を見るだけだ、三分だけでいい。席を外してもらえないか？」<br>
                    看護師は溜息をつき、彼女の腕時計を叩くと「三分。超過は認めません」と言って部屋から出て行った。<br>
                    黒髪の兵士は看護師が出て行くや否やベッドの柵を両手で持ち、上体をずり上げるとベッドに身を起こした。<br>
                    ケビンはその姿を見て、<br>
                    「それは許可を得たのか？ お寝んねしてろよ」とニヤニヤと笑う。<br>
                    「局所麻酔じゃ眠れんさ、それにかすり傷だ。これは俺の権利、リハビリだ」彼は柵から手を離すと禿頭の巨体に右手を差し出した。<br>
                    ケビンは無言で頷くとその手を取り、二人はがっしりと握手を交わす。数秒間、無言で目を合わせて手を解く。サイファーが口を開いた。
                    「ゴーストは……どうなった。俺の代わりに、彼は……」<br>
                    ケビンはその先を遮る。<br>
                    「会ってきた……まだ、ここに居る。お前はとにかくその傷を塞げ。ところで……」<br>
                    と、真顔になるとサイファーの耳に口を寄せた。<br>
                    「Delta—OBJECT ICE SECURED. SABER-1 GREEN. ZERO CAS. Relay in hand.（デルタ -
                    目標氷を確保。セイバー1緑。キャスゼロ。リレー手持ち。）」
                    それを聞いたサイファーの目が見開かれた。<br>
                    ──彼らのチームの犠牲は……ゼロ。<br>
                    ケビンが重々しく言う。<br>
                    「お前たちが、彼らの道を作った。それを言いに来た」<br>
                    「……そうか……良かった。ああ……良かったよ」<br>
                    兵士はカーテンが引かれた病室の窓を見つめた。ケビンも無言で、その友の顔をじっと見つめている。<br>
                    暫く経って彼が口を開きかけた時、ケビンの大きな手が肩を強く叩き、兵士は顔を顰めた。<br>
                    「おい、少しは加減してくれ。いくら病院内でも、味方に吹っ飛ばされてはかなわん」<br>
                    ケビンは大声で笑った。<br>
                    「ハハハ、じゃあ頭を撫でてやる。これでどうだ、オ～、Good Boy？」<br>
                    本当に頭の上に伸びてきた大きな掌を彼は振り払って言う。<br>
                    「冗談はよせ、ケビン」<br>
                    ケビンは自分の禿頭を撫でながら笑った。<br>
                    「ふん、俺の禿をお前にも伝染（うつ）してやる。色男は今日限りだ、覚悟しろ」<br>
                    「准尉！」ドアが開く音と共に、大股で足早に部屋を横切ってくる足音が聞こえた。<br>
                    「……おっ？」<br>
                    振りむいたケビンを、ジェニファーの冷たい視線が射る。<br>
                    「いや……待て。こいつを元気にしようと、ちょっとからかっていただけだよ、ジェニファー。ほら、俺は何もしてないだろ？」<br>
                    ジェニファーはケビンの目を見据えると、厳かに宣言した。<br>
                    「患者を動かさないでください、准尉。今すぐ出て行かないなら、無線でMPを呼びます」<br>
                    わざとらしい甲高い声で「おい、おい！」と言うケビンをジェニファーは廊下へ押し出し、口をへの字にして音を立ててドアを閉めた。</p>

                <p>ケビンを病室から追い出したジェニファーは、輸血と輸液の袋を交換しながらサイファーと言う呼び名の負傷兵に尋ねた。 <br>
                    「夕食を残したようだけど、お気に召さなかった？　19時のトレーがそのままよ」<br>
                    サイファーはスタンドのクロスバーからぶる下がる大きなビニールの袋と股間を交互に指さすと、逞しい黒人看護師にウィンクをして言う。<br>
                    「ああ。それで腹が膨れちまうしな。それに、こいつ（尿カテーテル）も気になってね。外してくれないか？ そうすれば、食欲も出ると思うんだ」<br>
                    看護師は目を釣り上げて彼を睨んだ。<br>
                    「Hb8.2じゃ、まだダメ。戻ったばかりなのよ？……いずれにしても、ロペス先生に電話で確認しないと」<br>
                    「頼むよ、ジェニファー。忙しい君に変わって、俺が外してもいいぜ。煮ても焼いても食えないチューブのスパゲティは一本でも少ない方が、リハビリも軽快だろ？」<br>
                    サイファーはそう言うと右手を伸ばしてセージグリーンのスクラブパンツのウエストをつまみあげ、眉を上げて看護師の顔を見た。<br>
                    「……一応、ここは病院なのよ、前線じゃないんだから勝手なことをしないで。私たちとしては、それをつけていてくれた方が有難いんだけど」<br>
                    ジェニファーはパンツのウエストから延びる尿カテーテルとVAC包帯のポンプへのチューブ、そして包帯がまかれた患者の右腕を見て目を細め、心の中で溜息をついた。<br>
                    ──全然、面白くないわ。男は皆同じ……特に「ここに来る」男たちは。<br>
                    彼女は大きな溜息をつくと、<br>
                    「外せたとしても、トイレに立つときは必ずナースコールよ。それが条件」と言う。<br>
                    「わかった。ありがとう、ジェニファー。恩に着るよ」彼はウィンクして看護師に笑いかけた。その顔をじっと見て、彼女はカルテにペンを走らせる。<br>
                    『Avoidance and paralysis symptoms. Self-harm risk ↑（回避・精神麻痺症状あり。……自傷行為に注意）』<br>
                    ──明るすぎる。典型的な封印型ね、彼は要注意患者だ。
                    彼女は心で呟きながら患者となった兵士の顔を見て、ウィンクを返す。<br>
                    「では、またあとで。許可が取れたら、処置室からキットを持って来るわ」<br>
                    そう言うと彼に背を向けて目を細め、カルテを再び手に取った。<br>
                    『Pt: inappropriate humor ↑（不適切ユーモア ↑）』<br>
                    ジェニファーはカルテに一文を書き足すと肩をひょいと竦め、リスターカートを押して病室を出た。</p>

                <p>サイファーはドアの隙間から静まり返った廊下をゆっくりと見回すと、音を立てずにドアからスタンドを滑り出させた。<br>
                    ──動き続けなければ、俺は立てなくなってしまう。<br>
                    輸血と輸液の透明な袋を下げたIVスタンドを左手で支えると、彼は蛍光灯が瞬く薄暗い廊下に一歩を踏み出した。一時間半前に大人しくナースコールを押したサイファーが看護師から上手く聞き出したトイレの場所は、廊下を東に進み、つきあたった先だ。<br>
                    ──クソ点滴め、おかげで腹がパンパンだぜ。<br>
                    ナースセンターでモニターを確認する人員も出払ってしまっているのか、彼の小さなルール違反に駆けつけて来る者は誰もいなかった。<br>
                    スタンドに縋るようにして、サイファーは右足を引きずりながらリノリウムの床を進む。<br>
                    大腿に入り込んだ細かなデプリ（破片）を摘出した切開創は、白いVACシートで塞がれている。シートに繋がれた腰のポンプが空気を吸い込むたびに、シートの下のホチキスが皮膚を噛み直す。<br>
                    サイファーは顔を顰めると、腹の中で毒づいた。<br>
                    ──くそ、最新式だか何だか知らんが、邪魔だ。サイボーグになった気分だ。<br>
                    なんとかトイレにたどり着いて用を足し、再びドアの隙間から廊下を伺うと、10メートルほど向こうから軍服の男が一人歩いて来た。<br>
                    ──問題ないな。
                    一歩踏み出したとき、横に回していたVACポンプがずり落ちた。彼はそれを素早く手で押さえて内心で毒づくと、位置を直して顔を上げる。<br>
                    突然、視界が白く瞬いて火花が散った。耳の奥で金属音がはじけて大きくなり、彼の体がぐらりと傾く。<br>
                    ──まずい。<br>
                    左手を伸ばして強く握り締めたIVスタンドのキャスターがひとつ、床から浮き上がる。<br>
                    左腕の輸液ラインが弦のようにピンと張った。スタンドを抑えようと伸ばした右手が空を切り、彼の体はさらに前にのめる。</p>

                <p>その男は腕時計にちらりと目をやり、急ぎ足で廊下を歩いていた。<br>
                    ──回収した封印バッグのおかげで短い休憩ができたが……おい、出発まであと10分だ。<br>
                    床に吸い付くビブラムソールの軍靴は、音もたてずに男を次のオペ（任務）へと素早く運んでいく。<br>
                    ──TAC Ward（外科トリアージ区画）を通過するためとは言え、いちいち丸腰は面倒だ。どうも、落ち着かんな。<br>
                    そのとき、廊下の先にある洗面所からスクラブを着た傷病兵が出てきた。男は足を止める。<br>
                    彼は体を傾けて右足を引きずり、IVスタンドに縋るようにして、ゆっくりと歩いてゆく。男は眼を細めた。<br>
                    ──この近くで戦闘があった話は聞いてないな。通信塔（あれ）を破壊したSFのメンバーか？　えらく細いが。<br>
                    男は、ふっと息を吐いた。反対側へ歩き出そうと踵を返したとき、傷ついた兵士は突然バランスを崩し、IVスタンドが大きく傾いた。目の端でそれを捉えた男の体が、瞬時に動く。</p>

                <p>サイファーの霞んだ目に、汚れたリノリウムの床が迫る。ステンレスのクロスバーが床に打ち付けられる大きな音を想像しながら、体を丸めて受け身の体勢を取ったとき、視界に迷彩の袖が現れて脇腹に滑り込む。<br>
                    逞しい腕に彼の上体は抱え上げられ、床に打ち付けられるはずのクロスバーは、床上十センチで空中に静止している。<br>
                    浅く喘ぐサイファーのスクラブの胸元からドッグタグが零れ出た。それは振り子のように揺れてポールに触れ、すべてが静止した空間に“カン”と硬質な音をひとつ残した。<br>
                    霞んだ目が、その男の煤で汚れた軍服の腿にうっすらと残るホルスター跡を捉える。<br>
                    その瞬間、彼が歩き続けたアルカイムの乾いた砂と KAC のMicro-BUIS
                    に焼け付いた粉煙の臭い、そして甘いCLP（　）の鉱油臭が男の袖口から滲み、サイファーの鼻腔を刺した。汗の匂いに混じったその臭気は彼を再び戦場に舞い戻らせ、本能的に危険を知らせた。<br>
                    ──殺られる。<br>
                    一気に冷や汗が噴き出し、負傷兵は体を凍り付かせる。<br>
                    気配を殺して滑るように自分に近づいたその男は味方だ、と言う現実を数秒後に取り戻して、彼は大きく息を吐いた。<br>
                    男はスタンドを素早く立て、負傷兵の肩に手を置いて壁に誘導すると、リノリウムの床に座らせた。<br>
                    自分の鼓動より半拍遅れて戻る呼吸が、鋭利なナイフのように胸を刺し、サイファーは目を閉じて歯を食いしばる。<br>
                    息を整えてゆっくりと目を開けると、青緑色の瞳がまっすぐに彼を見つめていた。<br>
                    短く刈られた男の赤毛は砂埃が乗り、泥と汗がまだらになった顔にはゴーグル跡が縁取られ、ところどころに張り付いた砂が弱々しい蛍光灯に反射して光る。<br>
                    男は声を出さず、眉を上げて負傷兵に問いかけた。<br>
                    “問題ないか? ”<br>
                    サイファーも声を出さずに大きく頷く。<br>
                    “ああ。大丈夫だ”<br>
                    男の軍服の胸には、IDも階級章もない。二の腕にあるはずのパッチも外され、晒されたベルクロとその縫い跡が彼の正体を暗に示していた。男の腰に目を落とすと、カスタマイズしたらしき短めのベルトキットをしている。<br>
                    男は彼の呼吸に合わせて揺れるドッグタグに目をやり、驚いたように目を見開く。<br>
                    彼は二枚の薄い金属の板をそっと摘み上げ、スクラブの中に滑り込ませた。<br>
                    そして、その胸に軽く手を当てると、<br>
                    トーン、トン、トーン、トン （−･−･）<br>
                    トン、トン、トーーン （･･−）<br>
                    と、スクラブ越しの胸に指を打ち、そして滑らせた。<br>
                    男は彼と目を合わせたまま、フッ、と浅く息を吐き切り、微かな袖の衣擦れだけを残して立ち上がった。<br>
                    そして座り込んだままの彼の肩を右手でポンとひとつ叩き、足音を立てずに影のように視界から消えた。<br>
                    傷ついた兵士が動くたびにチューブが揺れてポールに当たり、乾いた小さな音を立てる。</p>

                    ──マイケル。ダニエル。トミー。……カイル。ルーカス。<br>
                    彼は廊下に座り込んだまま、今はもういないゴーストたちの名を一つずつ、頭の中で呼んだ。<br>
                    ──……そして、リリー……俺たちのRelayを、彼らが受け取った。<br>
                    傷ついた兵士は自嘲した。<br>
                    ──だが……お前たちはもう二度と帰ってこない。俺だけが、まだこうして生きている……情けないな。<br>
                    彼は視線を戻すと、左腕の輸液の針と、その先のクロスバーからぶる下がる二つの袋をじっと見つめる。<br>
                    ──血も涙もとっくに絞り出したはずなのに、こうしてまた与えられる。<br>
                    涙は出なかった。<br>
                    彼はうす昏い廊下に座ったまま壁に背を預け、声を出さずに長い間、一人で笑っていた。</p>
