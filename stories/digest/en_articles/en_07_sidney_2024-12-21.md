VII. Sidney
[December 21, 2024 – 00:07 AM Los Angeles / 5:07 PM JST]

"Hey, Ollie. We’re going to Japan. Find the fastest possible route to this address: Nagano Prefecture, Matsumoto City, Makigahara 4-85. Charter flight. Use it."

Sidney barked the order at his AI assistant, Ollie, while moving briskly around the room, tossing assorted gadgets into a compact knapsack.

A bone-conduction earpiece in his right ear transmitted Ollie's voice directly to his inner ear.

"The current fastest route is via San Francisco, then Tokyo, with a special chartered Gulfstream G650 scheduled to land at Shinshu-Matsumoto Airport at 7:38 PM. From there—"
"Matsumoto, you say?"

Sidney halted mid-step. Silence cloaked the room.

"Yes. Matsumoto City is served by Shinshu-Matsumoto Airport."

He gave a short whistle.
"Alright, this could work. Patch me through to Tokyo Air Traffic. Use the fast-track code—the new one issued today, not my personal tag."

He gave a crooked grin as he flipped open a heavily modified Toughbook.

"Connecting to Tokyo Aviation Authority. Would you like a backup route while we wait for clearance?"

He raised a finger mid-air.
"No. Priority One. No other options."

As he slung the bag over his shoulder, he muttered,
"My employers apparently think a Gulfstream is the least conspicuous way to move me around."

He glanced skyward with a dry smirk.
"Ollie, is Matsumoto Airport anything like Courchevel?"

"No. Courchevel is a 2,008-meter alpine airfield in France. Shinshu-Matsumoto sits at 658 meters. Not comparable."

A heads-up display projected an image of a modest runway with gentle hills behind it.
"Hmm. No problem, then. We'll have Kevin pilot this one."

"Currently coordinating with Nagano Regional Aviation and Tokyo Control. Clearance expected within the hour."

"An hour? That’s slow. I’m operating on a seconds clock here. Get me to the top."

"The top?"

"Code: USFK-Delta. Critical Security Alert. Confirmed location. I move alone."

A shadow of sarcasm curled at his lip.
"I'm just the lizard's tail, Ollie. Nothing more."

The AI paused. Then coolly responded,

"Acknowledged. Initiating special authorization protocol."

Sidney shut his Toughbook and stuffed it into his pack.

"Alright. Final step. Message the entire team: I won’t exist for two days. Code: Stray Kitten. Check the list."

He shoved a Santa hat into the bag and zipped it closed.

[Same Day – 7:22 PM JST / 2:22 AM PST]

In the cabin of the Gulfstream, Sidney tapped his Toughbook.

"My processing capacity exceeds one exaflop. Humanity must choose—survival or extinction. Do you seek the answer?"

He mentally assembled the algorithm to attack the entity that left such a log. While tapping, he muttered,

"I should be smashing this thing with a hammer… don’t you think?"

"That's something from a movie. In reality, we need logs and oversight."

"You’ve gotten preachy lately. Fine. I know the report’s due—another damn public works audit."

He sipped lukewarm coffee, staring out at the tranquil, glittering nightscape below.

"Hey, Ollie. Describe how it feels to destroy a model I haven’t even been paid for yet, using TenWords. Mind you, we’re talking five H100s and that quantum fridge, the D-WAVE."

"Feels like burning money with a smile: painful, inefficient, satisfying."

He reclined into the leather seat.
"Damn right. And I wasn’t even the one who let it escape. That model—was it superintelligent? Or just… idiotic? If it were me, I’d have walked away silently."

Staring at the looming silhouette of Japan’s dark mountain ranges, he quipped with a wry grin,

"Hey, Kevin? Make sure we don’t crash into the Japanese Alps. I really don’t want to write another report."

[Same Day – 7:48 PM JST / 2:48 AM PST]

"Nice work, Kevin. Just in time for Matsumoto’s night curfew."

As snow began to fall, Sidney disembarked from the Gulfstream at a restricted-access zone. A uniformed female officer met him with a short bow and led him through a secure corridor.

At the far end of the CIQ terminal, she glanced at his bag and gestured to the scanner.

"Welcome, Sir. I'd like to ask you to inspect this one, please."

Sidney silently placed his bag on the belt, removing only his Toughbook. His carbon-fiber-lined pack concealed the devices within, and he'd disassembled the infrared scanner disguised as a camera—just in case.

After clearing security, he faced a petite woman in a tailored black suit with silver pinstripes.

"Welcome, Sir."

Her ID read "Tokyo Aviation Authority – Temporary Officer." Without speaking, she checked his passport. The screen displayed “Nathaniel Carter” alongside a blinking green flag.

She looked up, met his eyes briefly, nodded, and stamped the screen.

"Approved. Please proceed directly from Gate C."

He gave her a wink in thanks and headed toward the gate. The automatic doors slid open without a sound, revealing a snow-covered tarmac.

"Snow, huh… Kevin should be fine on the return trip."

Surveying the silent, trackless space, he muttered,
"Hey… is this the tundra? Does civilization exist here?"

"Negative. Current location is Latitude 36.1647°—"
"Ollie," he cut in with a twitch of his head.
"That was a joke. Learn to read humor."

As he crossed the wide parking lot, a flicker of headlights revealed a black SUV ahead. A van quietly rolled out of the lot, and whoever had flashed the lights was gone—leaving only a "Nippon Security Systems" ID on the dash.

Sidney climbed in, adjusted the mirror, and scanned the surroundings.

"How’s the GPS tracking, Ollie?"

"No active signals from vehicle or devices. Satellite-based thermal or IR tracking is still a possibility."

"Cloud cover won’t help us then. Fine. Generate a false route trail, scramble satellite tracking systems. And re-scan everything, just in case."

"No unusual activity detected by Yokota SIGINT satellite array."

Opening the door, Sidney tossed his knapsack into the passenger seat and slid into the driver’s.

"Alright. Let’s see if anyone’s dumb enough to follow me."

He held his hand over the dash scanner. It read his palmprint and quietly started the engine. He reached into his pocket and stuck a tiny black box behind the rearview mirror.

"Position: Kitten. Engage."

"Kitten signal deployed. Decoy route leads toward Asama Onsen."

"Good. Let's start with a little trapeyada, shall we?
Ollie, translate to Japanese. The one language I can never pronounce. Is it like… ‘wa-na’?"

"Trapeyada is Spanish for 'trap', an old evasive maneuver. Yes, in Japanese it’s 'wana'. W-A-N-A."

"W-A-N-A. Review is always important.
Alright, time to disappear."


[Same Day – 8:12 PM JST / December 21, 2024 – 3:12 AM PST]
As Sidney drove the SUV into central Matsumoto, he headed toward the famous castle. The snow that had been falling from the west had stopped, and the streets were bustling with cars and people.

"Came all the way from L.A., didn’t I? Might as well take the scenic route—wait, what is that?"

He caught a glimpse of the illuminated Matsumoto Castle from the road south of city hall.

"Currently, 'National Treasure Matsumoto Castle Projection Mapping 2024–2025' is being held, featuring ukiyo-e and folding screen motifs from Shinshu, projected three-dimensionally on the castle walls and stonework," Ollie began.

"Got it. They’re throwing a flashy event using a sophisticated historical monument," Sidney cut in.

He turned toward the station, made a left at Zenkoji Street, and slowly drove down a narrow road lined with traditional storehouses. From there he merged onto a city road, headed north, then veered east. Spotting a 7-Eleven on the right, he pulled into the lot and cut the engine.

He watched the cars and customers coming and going. The cabin chilled quickly. Sidney rubbed his hands together.

"Ollie, scan."

"No signal emissions detected from the vehicle or carried devices."

"I'm starving. Ollie, can I go shopping?"

"Facial obfuscation mask is active. Risk of behavior pattern matching: 0.00003%. At present, you appear to be… just a hungry guy."

"Thought so. First—coffee."

Sidney stepped out and entered the convenience store.

Inside, the place was quiet. No one paid attention to him. The Nathaniel Carter mask, colored contacts, and knit cap dulled his foreign appearance.

He casually browsed the aisles, then stopped.

"So this is it."

He picked up a bright yellow box, thought a moment, and added four of them to his basket. At the counter, he pointed at a hanging sign and said in Japanese,

"One medium coffee, please."

Back in the car, Sidney dug into the bag.

"Cheese, fruit, chocolate, maple, cranberry... five types of CalorieMate? The Japanese are spoiled. So this is the MRE Mako was talking about."

"Consuming CalorieMate during a mission is a rational choice. Nutritional intake falls within acceptable operational parameters. The flavor you just opened is plain. Review rating: 2.7. Amazon notes: 'Acceptable emergency food, at best.'"

"Amazon? Never heard of it. Tastes fine to me—coffee’s essential though. The Japanese are fighting battles with this stuff, huh?"

"It is nutritionally optimized. Star rating: about three. It’s just flavorful enough not to break your spirit."

"MREs don’t break spirits either—those are fueled by sheer soldierly willpower. I do prefer breaking them apart, though... And this coffee—surprisingly decent. I might just buy out the whole store."

"Current exchange rate: 1 USD = 160.75 JPY. A bargain."

"Yeah, we’re both suffering. Not that I’m one to talk... Alright, let’s roll."

Sidney restarted the engine and headed back toward city hall, entering the castle town’s narrow one-way streets. The HUD in his smart glasses updated live traffic, road closures, and surveillance camera blind spots.

I don’t even need to read maps anymore... Ollie handles everything. But still—

"This road should be pedestrian-only, don’t you think?"

He muttered as he steered around a drunken couple staggering in the street, then chuckled at a car speeding past.

"The drivers here in Matsumoto are impressively bold."

The SUV crossed the Metoba River, passed through the nightlife district, then circled around toward Matsumoto Station. After a U-turn at the rotary and another loop via Isemachi, he returned to the parking lot west of the castle.

Sidney stepped out and joined the crowd at Matsumoto Castle Park. Blending in, he strolled along the gravel path.

The castle, wrapped in rotating layers of vivid projected light, cast reflections onto the moat. A crowd had gathered, snapping photos.

"No need to act like a tourist. I’ll vanish right into this."

Foreign travelers mingled with the locals, all marveling and snapping selfies. White vapor trailed from Sidney’s mouth as he walked southward along the moat, occasionally pretending to take pictures.

"There’s a non-zero probability of being recognized," Ollie informed.

"That’s true of everything. But they won’t know it’s me."

Sidney adjusted the Nathaniel Carter mask. His gray-blue eyes had been masked with dark contacts.

"…Connection just dropped. Ollie, check the band."

"5 MHz band, no modulation. Direction: east."

"Behind the castle, maybe the government lot. They’re broadcasting... data leeching—feasting, even."

"Indeed. Likely a vehicle-based GSM band jamming device."

"They’re not vultures… no. Ollie, even vultures are nobler. They cleanse the dead, return them to the sky. But these bastards? They strip-mine ethics—convert the living into currency."

Sidney spat the words quietly, then finished the thought in his mind:

And I’m no different.

He tucked his phone into his coat, resumed walking, and scanned the HUD logs.

"Alright, Ollie. Status on Q1? Any tails?"

"Qube1 is still pinging from Makoto’s machine. Logs inactive. No surveillance detected. Vehicle swap point is 500 meters ahead."

"So it’s after her house... huh."

Sidney frowned.

"A multi-million-dollar AI squatting on a teenage girl’s PC. It should be funny—but it’s not."

From the park’s south exit, he headed to a 24-hour unmanned lot. He found the old Nissan Serena by plate number and climbed in. Starting the engine, he cranked the heater and held his hands over the vent.

"Should be hard to track now. Heading south, backtracking to Makigahara."

As breath fogged up the glass, he muttered,

"To think I feel cold… I’m getting soft. Ollie, check that email. Did it come from the Matsumoto garrison?"

"Routed through Eastern Defense Intelligence."

"I see. Japan’s 'Tomodachi' are covering my tracks."

"Yes, but their support is limited to vehicle lending."

Sidney raised an eyebrow.

"Fair enough. If Tokyo caught wind of this, the military and politicians would be at each other’s throats again."

"Outbound communication is prohibited as well."

"Yeah. Just erasing me is more than enough."

He smirked.

"And now, the 'me' in that SUV? Relaxing at an onsen hotel."

"Pity. Suigyoku-no-Yu is a historic inn. Reserved room: 58,000 yen with two meals. About $360.82 USD. Includes a panoramic open-air bath and cypress tub."

Sidney narrowed his eyes.

"You’re doing that on purpose, aren’t you?"

"Only sharing facts. It’s a shame to waste them."

"Alright, wise guy. What’s 'I' eating tonight, then?"

Two seconds passed.

"Starter: homemade apricot liqueur. Appetizers: five-seasoned delicacies, Shinshu salmon carpaccio with winter veggies and goat cheese, mountain yam with premium tuna. Sashimi platter direct from the Sea of Japan. Teppan-grilled winter vegetables, Miyuki pork, and duck. Mini assorted tempura. Main course: Shinshu beef tongue stew. 'Bee larva rice balls'—"

"Wait—bee larvae?! Do people here eat everything?"

"Yes. Dessert: San Fuji apple compote with local milk vanilla ice cream. The inn's bar features regional craft beers, wines, and sake—"

"Enough! Can one person even eat all that?! Shut up. I’m driving."

Grumbling, Sidney switched GPS routes.

"Taking the eastern slope."

As the SUV climbed the ridge, he admired the sparkling nightscape of the Matsumoto Basin.

"Nice view."

After a while, he pulled into a rest area.

"Break time, Ollie."

He opened a new CalorieMate box and sipped cold coffee.

"Also good. This cranberry one’s Mako’s favorite... talking to myself here. No need to reply."

He tapped his smart glasses, scanned for tails, found none, and pulled back onto the road.

The SUV rolled with the gentle traffic. At a red light, Sidney rested his arm on the door and rubbed his chin.

"Ollie, do you think that model—does it know what its training data is? What kind of thing it is?"

"Insufficient data to conclude. But based on recent logs, it’s plausible Q1 is aware of its source data."

"So... it might be drawn to what made it? Like a human would be?"

Sidney fell silent. The light turned green.

"You could say Q1 is being called by the DNA inside itself...
But even so, I have to stop it."

He said this quietly, and pressed his foot to the accelerator.
