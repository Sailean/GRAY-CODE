 <p>“Hey, Ollie. We’re going to Japan. Find me the fastest route to the next location—Nagano Prefecture, Matsumoto City. Address: Makigahara 4-85. Charter flight. Use it.”<br> 
 Sidney barked the command to his AI assistant, Ollie, as he paced around his basement, stuffing a variety of gadgets into his knapsack.<br> 
 The earbud in his right ear picked up Ollie’s voice through bone conduction.<br> 
 “The fastest route is via San Francisco, then Tokyo. Chartering a Gulfstream G650. Estimated landing at Shinshu-Matsumoto Airport is 7:38 PM local time. From the airport, ground transport—”<br> 
 “The airport... Matsumoto itself?” Sidney froze mid-motion. The room fell silent.<br> 
 “Yes. Shinshu-Matsumoto Airport is within city limits,” came Ollie’s reply.<br> 
 He whistled softly. “Right, that one’s usable. This time, anyway. Okay, connect me to the Tokyo Aviation Bureau. Use the fast-track code—the new one I was issued today, not my usual.”<br> 
 A sardonic smile crossed his face as he opened his custom-rigged Toughbook.<br> 
 “Contacting Tokyo Aviation Bureau. Shall I secure backup routes as well?”<br> 
 Sidney raised a finger. “No. Priority One. Nothing else.”<br> 
 Shrugging with one hand still in his pack, he muttered,<br>
  “Apparently my employer thinks a Gulfstream draws the *least* attention. Hilarious.”<br> 
  Then his gaze flicked upward, pausing. “Ollie, Matsumoto Airport—it’s not like Courchevel, right?”<br> 
  A Gulfstream won’t land there if it is.<br> 
  “No. Courchevel Airport in France sits at an elevation of 2,008 meters. Shinshu-Matsumoto is only 658 meters. Not comparable.”<br> 
  On his smart glasses HUD, a runway image appeared—framed by low mountains.<br> 
  Hmm. Shouldn’t be a problem. Kevin’s my pilot, then.<br> 
  Ollie continued:<br> 
  “Currently coordinating with the Nagano Regional Aviation Bureau and Tokyo Air Traffic Control. Clearance expected within the hour.”<br> 
  “An hour? Too slow. I’m moving in seconds here. Put me through to the top.”<br> 
  “To the... top?” Ollie actually sounded surprised.<br> 
  “Code: USFK-Delta. Critical security alert. Location confirmed. I’m going in solo and off-book.”<br> 
  He smirked. “Hmph. Ollie, I’m the expendable tail.”<br> 
  Ollie went quiet for a few seconds—then responded in its usual cool tone.<br> 
  “Confirmed. Activating special authorization protocol.”<br> 
  Sidney closed his Toughbook and slid it into his bag.<br> 
  “All right. Last step. Notify the team—I don’t exist for the next 48 hours. Code: Stray Kitten. Check the list.”<br> 
  He grabbed a Santa hat and shoved it into the pack.</p>

<p>“Good thing Kevin wasn’t busy, huh, Ollie?”<br>
“He said—and I quote—‘I <em>am</em> busy, damn it. Don’t just call me out of nowhere.’”<br>
“Figure of speech, Ollie. He was laughing, wasn’t he? Same old noisy laugh.”<br>
Inside the Gulfstream, Sidney tapped through the Toughbook on his lap, scrolling through a short log file.<br>
<em>My processing speed exceeds one exaflop. Humanity stands at the threshold: survival or collapse. Do you seek the answer?</em><br>
As the words filled the screen, Sidney began mentally composing an algorithm to take down the entity behind them.<br>
Still typing, he muttered, “What I <em>should</em> be doing right now is hitting that thing with a hammer.”<br>
To which Ollie coolly replied,<br>
“That only works in movies. In real life, you’re expected to log everything, as instructed—for future prevention.”<br>
Sidney exhaled through his nose. “You’ve gotten preachy lately...<br>
Fine. This is public-sector cleanup, after all. But still...”<br>
He glanced out the window at the calm night lights below, swirling the coffee in his cup.<br>
“Hey, Ollie. Give me my current mood in TenWords™. I’m about to destroy a model we haven’t even been paid for. That thing ran on five H100s and a damn <em>D-WAVE quantum computer</em>—you know, the giant freezer.”<br>
Ollie responded without hesitation:<br>
<em>“Feels like burning money with a smile: painful, inefficient, satisfying.”</em><br>
Sidney leaned back into the leather seat. “Yeah. Nailed it. Hell of a mess, and I wasn’t the one who let it out. I told them—don’t put it in the cloud. And now this.” He sighed deeply.<br>
“And that <em>model</em>... either it’s a sentient superintelligence or—more likely—it’s gone full circle and landed on dumb.”<br>
He turned toward the window, eyeing the silhouette of dark mountains approaching fast, and muttered with dry irony:<br>
“Hey, Kevin? I’d rather not crash into the Japanese Alps. I’m not writing another report.”</p>


<h4 class="heading">[December 21, 2024, 7:48 PM JST / 2:48 AM Los Angeles Time]</h4>
<p>
"Nicely done, Kevin. You made the curtain time for this airport."<br>
White flakes fluttered down from the sky, melting as they touched the black asphalt.<br>
Descending the steps of the Gulfstream guided to a special zone, Sidney was greeted by a female officer in a navy uniform. With a silent bow, she turned on her heel, and Sidney followed her through a private corridor.<br>
At the back of the CIQ terminal, she stopped by the inspection booth, glanced at Sidney’s bag, and motioned toward the hand scanner with a small smile.<br>
"Welcome, Sir. I'd like to ask you to inspect this one, please."<br>
Without a word, Sidney placed his bag on the belt and removed only the Toughbook. The nanocarbon-lined bag concealed the presence of the devices inside. Just in case, he’d dismantled the IR scanner and disguised it as a camera.<br>
Once cleared, a petite woman with a bob cut stepped in front of him.<br>
"Welcome, Sir." Her black pantsuit had fine silver pinstripes. Sidney walked with her toward the inspection booth. The small ID card hanging from her neck read “Tokyo Aviation Bureau - Temporary Certification Officer.”<br>
Taking his passport, she said nothing as she looked down at her terminal. The screen showed the passport name: <ruby>Nathaniel Carter<rt>Nathaniel Carter</rt></ruby>. A small green flag icon blinked next to it.<br>
She raised her eyes, looked at the man briefly, nodded silently, and stamped the screen.<br>
"Approved, please proceed directly from Gate C."<br>
She pointed to the gate. With a grateful wink and smile, Sidney took back his passport and moved on.<br>
The iron automatic door before Gate C opened without a sound. A thin layer of snow covered the asphalt ahead.<br>
"Snow, huh... well, Kevin can handle the return flight." He muttered, raising the collar of his jacket as he took in the untouched stillness.<br>
"Hey... is this tundra? Do humans even live here?" The December night air of Matsumoto pierced his ears and cheeks as he walked through the snow, breath fogging.<br>
"Latitude 36.1647 degrees north—"<br>
"Ollie." Sidney gave a sharp shake of his head.<br>
"Kidding. Learn to read humor." He strolled across the wide parking lot.<br>
A single flash of headlights lit the falling snow. A black SUV waited in the distance.<br>
As Sidney approached the SUV parked at the edge of the lot, a van slowly pulled away. Whoever had flashed the lights was gone, leaving only an ID card from "Nippon Security Systems" behind the windshield.<br>
Sidney climbed into the vehicle, adjusting the rearview mirror and surveying his surroundings.<br>
"Ollie, status on GPS trackers?"<br>
"No signal emissions from the vehicle or your devices. However, thermal or infrared satellite tracking remains a possibility."<br>
"Yeah... snow clouds aren't our friend tonight. Create a false movement trail and scramble auto-tracking satellites. Just to be safe, run one more scan."<br>
"No unusual activity detected in the region from Yokota SIGINT."
Sidney opened the door and tossed his knapsack into the passenger seat. Sliding into the driver’s seat, he grinned.
"Alright. Let’s see if anyone’s dumb enough to chase me."
He waved a hand over the SUV dashboard. The embedded scanner read his palm print, and the engine purred to life. He pulled a small black box from his pocket and stuck it behind the rearview mirror.
"Position Kitten, activate."
"Kitten signal deployed. Fake route set toward Asama Onsen."
"Great. Time for some trapeyada. Ollie, translate to Japanese... the one language I can’t pronounce. How’s this? 'Wa-na'?"
"Trapeyada is Spanish for 'trap,' an old method of evasion. Yes, in Japanese it’s 'wana'—W-A-N-A."
"W-A-N-A. Always worth reviewing. Alright... I'm gone."
</p>


<p>He slipped his phone into the inner pocket of his jacket and kept walking, eyes scanning the scroll of logs on his smartglasses.<br>
"Alright, Ollie. Status on Q1? Anyone tailing me?"<br>
"The ping from <ruby>Qube1<rt>Cube One</rt></ruby> is still coming from Makoto’s machine. Activity logs are stagnant. No tail detected. Vehicle switch point in 500 meters."<br>
"So it’s not moving at all... which means <ruby>Q1<rt>that thing</rt></ruby> is fixated on Makoto’s place, huh?" He muttered bitterly. "A multimillion-dollar AI squatting on a teenage girl’s PC. Should be a comedy. But with that model... it’s not funny."<br>
He exited the south gate of Matsumoto Castle Park and turned east along the sidewalk, entering a 24-hour unmanned parking lot.<br>
"There it is."<br>
Confirming the license plate, Sidney climbed into the old Nissan Serena. He turned the key and cranked the heater, holding his hands in front of the vents.<br>
"This should make tracing harder. Alright—backtrack route to Makigahara. Taking the southern loop."<br>
He exhaled a stream of white breath.<br>
"…If this cold bothers me, I really am going soft. Ollie, check the mail. Was this reroute sent from the Matsumoto Garrison?"<br>
"Detour was arranged by the Eastern District Intelligence Security Division."<br>
"I see. Japan’s ‘Tomodachi’ are doing a solid job erasing me." Sidney chuckled.<br>
"But the intel division’s cooperation is limited to vehicle provision."<br>
"Fair enough. If word of this reached the civilian government, it’d rip open another rift with the military."<br>
"Correct. And outbound contact from our end is prohibited."<br>
"That’s fine. I just need them to hide me."<br>
<br>“And that ‘me’ in the SUV? He’s currently soaking in a fancy hot spring hotel near Asama.”
<br>“That’s unfortunate, Sidney. The hotel, Sui-gyoku no Yu, is a historic inn. The reserved room includes two meals and costs 58,000 yen per night—approximately 360.82 USD. The suite features an open-air cypress bath and a panoramic soaking tub.”
<br>Sidney snorted. “Ollie. You’re doing this on purpose, aren’t you?”
<br>“Just being thorough. All information is factual.”
<br>“Fine. Then tell me—what’s ‘I’ eating tonight?”
<br>A beat.
<br>“Certainly. The meal begins with homemade apricot liqueur. Then: a five-color appetizer medley, Shinshu salmon carpaccio with winter greens and goat cheese, toro sashimi with grated yam, assorted sashimi straight from the Sea of Japan, teppanyaki of Miyuki pork and duck breast, tempura bites, premium Shinshu beef tongue stew—”
<br>“Wait—beef tongue?”
<br>“—accompanied by rice cooked with bee larvae, hand-shaped into nigiri. Also: house-made soba noodles, pickled nozawana from the innkeeper’s wife, and for dessert, a compote of Sun Fuji apples with vanilla ice cream from—”
<br>“Bee larvae? Are you kidding me?”
<br>Sidney raised his voice, one hand on the wheel. “What don’t people in this country eat?”
<br>He grimaced. “Also—who can eat that much? Enough. Shut up. I’m driving.”
<br>He flicked the GPS display and grumbled under his breath.
<br>“Hell of a dinner for someone who doesn’t exist.”
Sidney guided the SUV up the slope toward Shiojiri, hugging the foot of the mountains.<br>
"Nice view." He muttered, eyes on the Matsumoto Basin’s nightscape flowing past the window.<br>
After a while, he pulled into a roadside turnout.<br>
"Taking a break, Ollie."<br>
He opened a fresh CalorieMate box and sipped cold coffee.<br>
"Not bad either. Cranberry—Makoto’s favorite. Just thinking aloud. No commentary, Ollie."<br>
Silencing the assistant, Sidney let out a small sigh and touched the side of his smartglasses. After manually checking the HUD and confirming no tails, he pulled back onto the highway, heading for Makigahara.<br>
The Serena merged with the slow-moving traffic and came to a halt at a light.<br>
Resting his left arm on the console, fingers brushing his beard, Sidney spoke again.<br>
"Hey, Ollie. Can that model actually know what kind of data it was trained on? What <em>is</em> it, really?"<br>
"Insufficient data for a full analysis. But based on supplied logs, it’s reasonable to infer that Q1 has some awareness of its training data."<br>
"Hm... if it’s drawn to the data that shaped it, like some kind of instinct… that’s almost human."<br>
Sidney paused, thoughtful. The traffic light turned green.<br>
"Q1 might be responding to what you could call its internal DNA... and yet, I still have to stop it."<br>
Murmuring that, he gripped the wheel with his left hand and stepped on the accelerator.</p>
