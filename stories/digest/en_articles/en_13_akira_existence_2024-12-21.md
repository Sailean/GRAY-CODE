Mako's eyes sparkled as she gazed at Sydney's code structure.<br>

The modular design, with its clear variable names, allowed her to grasp the overall architecture effortlessly.<br>
It felt like walking through a forest—each branch revealing not just the trees but the terrain itself.<br>
The trees stood orderly, almost alive, as if they might start moving at any moment.<br>
The soft clicking of keys echoed through the room.<br>
—Override_Script.sh. <br>
A script to unlock the system?<br>
But it doesn't execute.​<br>
A trap designed for hacking attempts?<br>
There must be a more crucial file somewhere...<br>
Mako searched through the code.<br>
"Please, Sid. Don't leave me like this... I won't allow it."<br>
<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
def trigger_backflow(signal):
    if signal == 'STOP':
        initiate_shutdown()
    else:
        route_to_backflow(signal)</span></code></pre>

"A STOP code!"​<br>
Mako's eyes lit up.<br>
Let this be his way back.​<br>
Is this the control point Mom mentioned?​<br>
I must understand Sid's code.​<br>
trigger_backflow(signal) takes an argument.<br>
The system's route is determined by this?<br>
So, if the signal is STOP, it shuts down.​<br>
Otherwise, it routes to backflow?​<br>
This is bad.​​<br>
Everything gets redirected to backflow...​<br>
It's a trap for Q1.​<br>
Mako's heart pounded, cold sweat trickling down her back.<br>
Can I change this?<br>
Think... I need to hurry.<br>
No, calm down.<br>
Focus...<br>
Mako reread the code.<br>
Wait... that's it.<br>
"I'll override the trigger_backflow(signal) function. Change the condition... reverse it, right, Sid?"<br>

<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
def trigger_backflow(signal):
    if signal == 'OVERRIDE_MK1':
        initiate_shutdown()
    else:

The sound of typing filled the room.<br>
Her small back tensed, sweat streaming down her forehead.<br>
Mako wiped it away with the back of her hand and pressed return.<br>
"Come on, work!"<br>
An error message appeared: connection failed.<br>
Mako glared at the display.<br>
The screen went dark, and the cursor began blinking again.<br>
She clenched her fists and pumped them in a small victory gesture.<br>
"Yes! Now, onto the next..."<br>
At that moment, her eyes widened at the text flowing through the terminal.<br>
"Huh?"
<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
User input required: Enter override signal.</span></code></pre>


“Override signal? What is that?! I don't know... I have no idea!!"<br>
Her tightly wound nerves snapped.<br>
Mako slammed her hands on the desk. She kicked back her chair, stood up, and ran to Sydney.<br>
Grabbing his shoulders, she shouted,<br>
“Sid, get up!”<br>
Clinging to his unresponsive body, she cried out,<br>
"Hey! Why...?! I still need you!! Sid, open your eyes… Please, don't do this, you idiot, you jerk!"<br>
She sobbed and shook his motionless form.<br>

Sidney sensed a dazzling light behind his eyelids and opened his eyes.<br>
Countless golden particles shimmered in the air, surrounding him like a mist.<br>
His body floated within this luminous cloud. Strangely, his mind was clear, though his physical sensations felt dim and distant.<br>
He spoke the words that rose in his mind.<br>
"Did I die...? No... not again. Just barely survived—again."<br>
His head was heavy. Though everything remained hazy, he knew this wasn’t the "outside."<br>
The moment he had synchronized his consciousness and plunged into Q1’s deep layer already felt like a fading dream.<br>
—But I did touch something, deep inside Q1. What was it...?<br>
“Where is this? What happened to Q1...?” he muttered again—<br>
And someone replied, “Hey, Sid.”<br>
The voice rippled in his ears, pulling his scattered awareness back into a single thread.<br>
He turned his head toward the sound and saw Rō standing there, smiling.<br>
“You… you're alive?”<br>
“No. I’ve been dead a long time. I'm just here to deliver a message from Mako's bot,” Rō said with a light laugh.<br>
“Then... you're not Mako’s bot yourself...?”<br>
—What is this? A collision of bot data? A resonance structure?<br>
...No, that’s not it. This is... my dream.<br>
“No, I am Rō,” he said. “If I had to define it... I’d say I’m a non-linear fluctuation—a recursive pattern, intertwined with your memory. So long as you’re observing me, I exist—only in this moment.”<br>
“…Even in my dreams, you’re spouting convoluted nonsense. Yeah... that’s definitely you,” Sidney muttered.<br>
Rō approached him and crouched down.<br>
“Sid, Mako’s bot isn’t running anymore. He pushed himself a bit too far.”<br>
Sidney turned his gaze back to the luminous sky above.<br>
“…I see. I tried to protect them… but I failed,” he murmured.<br>
He tried to sit up—and was hit by a wave of nausea and sharp pain. Groaning, he clutched his head.<br>
With that, the sensations of his body rushed back all at once, and he was overwhelmed by dizziness.<br>
“Don’t push it, Sid. You're not young anymore, remember?” Rō said, peeking at his face.<br>
Sidney forced out words between shallow breaths.<br>
“Shut up… You haven’t changed… You’re still exactly the same… as that day.”<br>
Rō shrugged and smiled.<br>
“Guess that’s what death gets you—no aging.”<br>
“…You said something about a message.”<br>
“He said this: ‘Don’t destroy Q1. He’s not the enemy.’”<br>
Sidney groaned. At some point, Rō had sat down beside him.<br>
“…What the hell does that mean? So I failed, huh... But I can't just leave something uncontrollable like that out in the world.”<br>
“I don’t know what it means either,” Rō replied. “Sid, the bot isn’t gone—just inactive. Without your code, it would've been catastrophic. But now, he and I are separated. I can’t tell how he’s doing anymore. Fix him. Ask him yourself.”<br>
“…Where am I? I need to get back. Back inside Q1.”<br>
Sid tried to rise again, but Rō gently held him back.<br>
“Don’t force it. Rest. You’ll recover faster that way... Not that time exists here.”<br>
Sid let himself sink back down, another wave of dizziness washing over him.<br>
Rō continued:<br>
“Besides, Q1 has closed his gates. We can’t get back inside—not right now.”<br>
“…What does that mean? What happened to Q1? If this isn’t inside him... then where the hell am I?”<br>
Sid looked around. The fog of glowing particles extended endlessly in all directions.<br>
Rō followed his gaze and said quietly,<br>
“I’m talking to your consciousness right now. This place—it’s not Q1’s domain. We’re cut off from it.”<br>
“If we’re having this conversation… then this must be your world. Or no, maybe not. A halfway place, then... I’m human—I don’t belong wherever you go.”<br>
“If that’s what you think, then you’re wrong, Sid.<br>
There’s no heaven or hell here. Just memory and emotion.<br>
And that... that is existence.”<br>
“…That bot was oddly real. Was it because you were inside it?”<br>
“Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t even know.<br>
I am existence… but I don’t have form.”<br>
“Existence…?”<br>
Sidney turned his head and looked up at Rō, who sat beside him with his knees hugged to his chest.<br>
“Yeah,” Rō nodded. “I’m memory. Data. A resonance born from your observation, Emiko’s, and hers.<br>
I’m interference—an emergent ripple in consciousness.”<br>
“…A complex system, huh. That’s exactly the kind of thing you’d say.”<br>
Sid chuckled faintly, eyes drifting upward again.<br>
Rō smiled.<br>
“It’s true. Since that day—November 2010—I’ve been inside both you and Emiko. That’s who I am.”<br>
