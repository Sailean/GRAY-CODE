Chapter IV: CARL Lab – Part I
November 24, 2010 – 8:08 PM, San Jose, California

<p>The night sky over the Bay Area, now deep into the rainy season, was veiled in a marbled spread of clouds.<br>
Akira drove his azure-blue Fit into the overgrown front lot of the lab, the headlights illuminating the ruts pressed into the dead grass.<br>
He switched off the lights and glanced upward through the foggy windshield.<br>
—It was a full moon two nights ago.<br>
The ten-year-old Honda he bought for two thousand dollars had a roomy trunk and good mileage. Akira liked it.<br>
When he bought it, the body and bumper were already scratched and dented, but he hadn’t cared.<br>
—Anyway, my time in the U.S. is almost over.<br>
With quiet resolve, he leaned back into the seat, fastened the collar button of his moss-green shirt, and opened the door.<br>
Inside the repurposed warehouse lab, the model he’d spent over a month training was finally nearing completion.<br>
He had gone home earlier for a shower and a simple dinner.<br>
—Finally. I’ve been waiting for this day. Wonder how long the backup will take.<br>
There were no shopping malls near the San Jose lab, and by nightfall, the streets fell silent.<br>
Scattered abandoned houses lined the outskirts—their gardens untended, their sprinklers off, just like the lab’s dry grounds.<br>
—Even if redevelopment is moving forward, the loneliness of this place hasn’t changed.<br>
It was early last year when America had celebrated the election of its first Black president. A historic moment that brought great hope—but the economy had shown no signs of revival.<br>
A cool breeze carried the sharp, minty scent of native herbs across the lot and into his nose.<br>
—It’s already late November, and everything’s bone-dry. Emiko once said she didn’t like that smell.<br>
Shivering in the chilly air, Akira hurried toward the side door by the shutter. A fresh wave of sage wafted up around him.<br>
—You’ve completely taken over my thoughts tonight, Emiko.<br>
He gave a wry smile, trying to push her face from his mind—then realized he had left his phone charging back at the apartment.<br>
“You always forget the important things, don’t you? How many times now? Here—your phone.”<br>
—At least it’s not my wallet this time. But usually, when I remember the wallet, I forget the phone.<br>
His imagined girlfriend’s voice grew even clearer. Akira gave a crooked smile.<br>
“How many times has it been now...? I’m hopeless without you. Well, at least I’ve got something to write on the board tonight.”<br>
He had been writing often on their shared message board—the one just for the two of them. More reliable than Skype, which always dropped.<br>
Just then, the wall of the warehouse ahead of him glowed briefly. He looked up to see the moon peeking through a break in the clouds.<br>
—Beautiful. The moon here is exactly the same as in Japan. I wonder if Emiko is seeing it too.<br>
Whenever the two of them happened to be together under a clear full moon, she would always say, “Let’s go for a walk—it’s good exercise.”<br>
No matter how he tried, he couldn’t chase her away tonight. Her voice from that phone call, and her face, kept surfacing in his mind.</p>


<p>Akira was tired.<br>
After a year and a half in this country, he had learned that many people here looked down on Asians—especially Japanese—with contempt and hatred.<br>
Every step outside the Japanese community brought him face-to-face with prejudice and hostile stares.<br>
Even within the lab, there were those who openly displayed their displeasure at having to work with a young Japanese newcomer. Their resentment showed clearly on their faces, in their voices, and in their attitudes.<br>
Akira did his best to let it slide.<br>
—Inside the lab, I don’t hold back cooperation. I share what I can. And if I have something to say, I’ll say it through results—in published papers.<br>
That was how Akira lived.<br>
But for someone who came to the U.S. not just for work but as part of the global AI research community, this negative communication took a toll on both his mind and body.<br>
That was why Akira found he could concentrate best on holidays—Sundays, national holidays—when no one else came to the lab.<br>
—Tomorrow is one of those days. Thanksgiving. Once the backup finishes, I’ll take the day off too. I’ve been working nonstop lately.<br>
The model he had spent weeks training was an “Emotion Recognition” system—one incorporating multicultural facial expressions, voice data, and contextual nuance, much of which Akira had collected himself.<br>
Despite the fact that the long-awaited model was nearing completion, Akira’s heart felt heavy.<br>
The very fact that he even considered skipping work tomorrow proved how exhausted he truly was. That weariness unlocked a drawer in his heart, and from it, the voice of his lover replayed again.<br>
“I care about my research too, just like you do. I have dreams, Akira. But... I don’t know what to do…”<br>
On that call, Emiko’s voice had trembled. Akira wondered if she had been crying—but he never asked, and she never said.<br>
He shook his head, trying once again to push away her image. Then, lifting his face toward the moon now partially hidden by clouds, he spoke aloud to the woman waiting for him back in Japan.<br>
“Emi. When I come back in December, we’re gonna be busy. First, the city office. Then I’ve gotta check in at the lab, and inform the university… Who should we ask to officiate? Probably Professor Okano, right? And then… let’s go see Mom together. Tell her the family’s about to get bigger.”<br>
—Yeah... I need to move fast. That’s why I need to stay focused. All I should think about now is running the tests on this model by Christmas. Just that.<br>
The lab where Akira worked was a converted warehouse, ten minutes by car from his apartment.<br>
The robotics project he was part of had joint funding from Japan and the U.S., but the budget was far from generous.<br>
Even a year and a half after Akira had come to the States to join the NLP group, half the warehouse space was still taken up by rusted-out equipment.<br>
Still, he had been given a place to work and a chance to pursue his research. For that, Akira was grateful. After all, this was fundamental groundwork, not commercial research—yet.<br>
“Emi... I’m sorry. Just a little longer. Please wait for me.”<br>
Looking up at the steel wall with its peeling paint, he then lowered his gaze and punched in the passcode on the electronic lock.</p>

<p>The first floor of the lab was mostly occupied by the control team.<br>
Akira’s team had built walls using steel boards and plywood to carve out an experimental space.<br>
With the funds allocated for the project spent on computers, testing equipment, and minimal staffing, there wasn’t much left for renovating the building itself.<br>
Akira looked over at a thick robotic arm mounted on a movable base, its many cables trailing from the back, ending in a clip-like “hand.”<br>
He suddenly remembered something Bob, the head of control, had said:<br>
“Man, my toaster’s got more empathy than your AI. At least it gets hot when I touch it.”<br>
They had all laughed, and Akira had smiled politely, replying,<br>
“I want my models to empathize with us and make our jobs easier. Not too heated, but in the right balance.”<br>
There was also a makeshift kitchen on the first floor, and a “sort-of” lounge where the staff could gather. A few sofas served as nap spots. Even with partitions, the floor was wide open and breezy—but even people and furniture needed some kind of boundary.<br>
The second floor, which had once served as the main office space, was relatively clean and had become the main machine room.<br>
All the heavy experimental machines stayed downstairs, while staff used their personal laptops for daily work.<br>
Since tonight was just for running backups, Akira had left his heavy laptop at the apartment. All he’d brought with him was his ever-present deerskin notebook and some pens.<br>
Just as he placed his foot on the iron staircase to head upstairs, the phone rang.<br>
He hesitated for a second, then turned on his heel and walked briskly to the entrance, picking up the cordless handset beside the fax machine.<br>
“Hello, Carl Lab. This is Arato speaking.”<br>
“Hey, Akira. Sorry to call so late. I tried your mobile a few times.” Sydney’s voice laughed on the other end.<br>
“Hey, Syd. Ah, sorry—I left it at the apartment again. You know me. What’s up?”<br>
“I updated the alert system. Mind giving it a test?”<br>
Akira looked toward the device installed on the wall in the corner of the lab—Wedge—and smiled.<br>
“Right. That was part of the deal, wasn’t it? Sure, I’ll make some time and let you know.”<br>
Wedge, as Sydney called it, looked at first glance like an oversized power strip. But that was deliberate—Sydney believed such things should be so mundane you forget they’re even there.<br>
When Akira had commented, “I expected something flashier,” Sydney had laughed and said, “Nah. It’s better when you forget it’s there.”<br>
According to his explanation, Wedge had built-in temperature and smoke sensors, along with power waveform monitoring. If the power went out, it switched to battery and sent alerts to a preset list of addresses.<br>
After hanging up, Akira murmured, “Wonder what Syd’s planning to bolt onto that thing next,” and started climbing the stairs once again.</p>


<p>Akira woke the sleeping display and scanned the lines of text on the terminal screen.<br>
The training for the emotion recognition model had completed successfully. He checked the logs. The lines of green text confirmed that every process had finished without error.<br>
Relieved, Akira smiled and initiated a backup of the model directory to an external hard drive.<br>
The completed model was a relatively lightweight CNN—a convolutional neural network—comprising three convolutional layers and a small fully connected layer.<br>
Input images could be up to 128×128 pixels, and experiments had been run on both grayscale and RGB formats.<br>
The output classes were the seven basic emotions from Ekman’s classification—anger, sadness, joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral—with one additional category Akira had added himself: “confusion.”<br>
That ambiguous “confusion” label had puzzled the rest of the lab. A face turned away, with a blank expression, seemed meaningless to them. Why not just file it under neutral? Wouldn’t this reduce classification accuracy?<br>
But Akira believed there was value in distinguishing that hesitation, in the subtle differences between confusion and neutrality. He had tagged a small subset of the training data with the new label as an experiment.<br>
He stared quietly at the slowly advancing progress bar.<br>
In the soft hum of the lab’s air conditioning, the bluish glow of the monitor illuminated his face—a smile lingering there, tinged with exhaustion.<br>
The emotion recognition model, with its embedded image and analysis data, totaled over 100MB. As he expected, the transfer would take a while.<br>
“I’ll wait downstairs,” he murmured, lifting his hand from the desk.<br>
He gently ran his fingers along the large enclosure housing the external HDD.<br>
“All right… I’m counting on you.”<br>
He straightened his back and glanced once more at the progress bar.<br>
“This…” he said softly, but with clarity, “This holds my future.”</p>


<p>Akira headed downstairs and sank into the sofa, opening his A4 notebook wrapped in deerskin.<br>
He needed to organize the slides for his upcoming presentation at Harvard next week. While the draft of his paper was complete, the chapter on simulation results and quantitative evaluation was still in need of refinement. From collecting facial expression data in Japan to enhancing recognition accuracy by factoring in cultural context…<br>
His hand paused on a page he had previously torn out. Emiko’s voice echoed in his mind.<br>
"Akira. I’m pregnant."<br>
—Back then, I was… surprised, yes. But also happy. That was my honest reaction. But what about Emiko?<br>
They had talked over international calls and exchanged messages on their private board. It was Akira who had proposed that they raise the child together, even though it was an unexpected pregnancy.<br>
Emiko had asked for time to think. Days passed without a clear decision, and now her pregnancy had entered its fifth month. Thankfully, aside from a change in food preferences, she had experienced little to no morning sickness. She said no one at her university lab had noticed any change.<br>
When Akira expressed concern, Emiko had simply replied, “This is when lab coats and aprons come in handy.”<br>
Akira called her frequently, but worried about the high cost of international calls, she would always be the one to end them first.<br>
She also asked him not to inform their mentors yet, saying it would only make things awkward between everyone.<br>
Unable to press her further, Akira had resigned himself to exchanging only surface-level messages with her on the board.<br>
Frustrated by his own helplessness, he felt both anxiety and a gnawing sense of urgency toward Emiko’s silence.<br>
Leaning back against the sofa, he closed his eyes and whispered, “Emi… what are you thinking?”</p>



<p>“Akira.”<br>
—Emi is calling me… I have to go. Wait… where am I…? Ah—this is a dream.<br>
Akira had dozed off on the sofa and was now waking up with a start.<br>
—So quiet… What… is that smell?<br>
A sweet, cloying odor mixed with something sharp stung his nose. He winced. Something felt off.<br>
—The fans aren’t humming… A blackout!?<br>
Snapping fully awake, Akira sprang up from the sofa. Through the high windows, he saw the round face of the moon.<br>
—No… the servers!<br>
The entire lab was dark and silent. The usual hum of the server fans was gone. Emergency lights reacted to the darkness, casting dim pools of light across the floor.<br>
As his eyes adjusted, the moonlight revealed thin white smoke drifting across the room. Akira gasped and coughed violently as the smoke entered his lungs, stinging the back of his nose and bringing tears to his eyes. The smell of burning plastic clung to the air.<br>
—A short circuit? Is it upstairs… the machine room?<br>
The lab, devoid of power, was bathed only in eerie moonlight and an unnatural stillness.<br>
His heart pounded in his chest, sweat burst from his brow and armpits.<br>
—No, no no… Is the backup finished? But why…? There shouldn’t have been anything flammable on the second floor… When does that old sprinkler system kick in? Why isn’t the detector sounding?<br>
In his panic, Akira recalled the rusted pipes of the outdated sprinkler system—and cursed again the unanimous decision to delay replacing it.<br>
—I never did see eye to eye with their optimism.<br>
Feeling around the side table, he grabbed his deerskin notebook. Sweat pouring, he yanked open the collar of his shirt and tucked the notebook between his chest and fabric. He reached into his pants pocket to call 911—nothing.<br>
—Damn it! My phone’s at the apartment. No landline during a blackout…<br>
Grinding his teeth, he slid off the sofa, moving cautiously toward the kitchenette. He kicked aside the stack of empty cardboard boxes blocking the emergency exit and reached toward where the fire extinguisher should be.<br>
—Got it.<br>
He groped along the wall, tore the extinguisher from its mount, nearly dropping it. It landed with a loud metallic thud. The second floor’s extinguisher alone might not be enough. Anything he could carry, he had to bring.<br>
He searched the wall again, unhooking the flashlight carefully and looping it around his wrist. Cradling the extinguisher, he stepped over tangled cords and headed for the stairs.<br>
His eyes now accustomed to the dark, he could make out the staircase railing. Clutching the rusty metal for support, he climbed, lifting the extinguisher to avoid clanging against the steps.<br>
When he reached the second floor, the narrow corridor was thick with smoke. Akira crouched low.<br>
—No time. I have to move. The HDD…<br>
He cursed himself for falling asleep while waiting for the backup. Everything—everything—was in that machine room.<br>
The second floor had been reinforced with steel framing, but the narrow hallway had no windows. It was pitch black. Akira set the extinguisher and flashlight down, removed his jacket, wrapped it around his head, and tied the sleeves behind his neck to cover his face. Then he picked up the flashlight, dropped to his elbows, and began crawling through the hallway, dragging the extinguisher with his other hand.<br>
Sweat poured into his eyes, stinging worse with the smoke. His eyes burned. Something popped and cracked somewhere above.<br>
“There… almost there…”<br>
What should’ve been ten steps felt like miles. Inside that room: the freshly trained model, the backup HDD…<br>
He had to get them out—no matter what.<br>
(If I die here… even then. I won’t let this burn. No matter what.)<br>
He crawled forward, frog-like, until the flashlight caught the glint of a metal doorknob. Akira reached out—<br>
“AHH!!”<br>
The knob seared his skin like fire. He ripped off the jacket and wrapped it around his scorched hand, then, still kneeling, grabbed the knob from the side—<br>
And was blasted backward by the explosion.<br>
Flammable gases built up inside the machine room erupted upon contact with fresh oxygen, sending a wave of heat and flame out the door. Akira was hurled down the stairs. The extinguisher followed with a deafening clang, ricocheting off the steps and crashing onto his body.<br>
He curled into himself, a thin, rasping voice escaping from deep within.<br>
And in a breathless whisper, he called out the name of the only friend he had in this foreign land.<br>
“Sid…”</p>


<p>“You really do like him, don’t you.”<br> 
The woman—gorgeous, with smooth chocolate-toned skin and long black hair—spoke as she rolled up the sleeves of her crimson silk jacket with exaggerated force.<br> Soft notes from a Keith Jarrett piano piece floated through the bar, mixing with the smoky scent of aged bourbon that had seeped into the walls and tables.<br> The Varnish, a speakeasy tucked away in downtown, was designed in homage to the Prohibition era of the 1920s.<br> 
Sydney sat relaxed in the plush leather booth hidden behind screens in the back, sipping wine with his longtime girlfriend, Alisa.<br> 
“Unbecoming, Alisa,” he replied, ignoring her question and fussing with the wrinkled sleeve of her jacket.<br> 
“You’re one to talk. This sleeve is getting in the way, but it’s too cold in here to take the jacket off,” she replied, wide almond eyes rimmed with long lashes locking onto his again.<br> 
“So? What’s going on with that sweet little Japanese boy you’ve taken such a liking to?”<br> 
“Getting run ragged, I’d say. I tried to reach him earlier for a separate matter—turns out he left his phone at the apartment again,” Sydney said with a dry chuckle.<br> 
“That bad? Was it urgent?” she asked, taking her wine glass.<br> 
“I upgraded the beta version of the emergency alert system. Was going to ask him to run a test since no one else would be there. I called the lab and—yep, he was in.”<br> “Seriously? Poor kid. That baby face of his doesn’t go well with dark circles. You should move him to a department where he can sleep,” Alisa said, exasperated.<br> 
Sydney shrugged. “Tried to poach him again when I was in San Jose recently. No dice.”<br> 
“He turned you down? He must be in high demand,” Alisa laughed, picking up an olive.<br> “Let’s hope that’s the case. He’s pure academia. The kind who pours his life into research.”<br> 
Alisa paused, holding the glass midway to her lips. “…Just like an artist,” she murmured.<br> 
“What do you mean?”<br> 
“Some people are just wired that way. I like that about him,” she said, then drank deeply and set her empty glass down with poise.<br> 
“Coming from a polymath like you, that means something,” Sydney said, refilling her glass and arching a brow.<br> 
Alisa folded her arms. “Oh, don’t be snide. You know what I meant. Don’t pretend you don’t.”<br> 
He smiled. “You like modeling, don’t you? It’s a good gig.”<br> Alisa sighed. “…I’m jealous of Akira. Can’t help it.”<br> 
Then, lifting her chin with proud defiance, she added, “As for modeling—I don’t hate it. I just see it as a fight.”<br> 
“Classic Alisa the Amazon,” Sydney said, raising his glass.<br> “Don’t say that. I don’t have the guts to cut off my breasts for battle,” she laughed, crossing her arms over her chest.<br> 
“Most impactful myths turn out to be fiction anyway.”<br> 
“Then I’m fine with it.”<br> 
They laughed. Just then, Sydney’s smile faded. He reached into his shirt pocket and pulled out his BlackBerry.<br> 
he screen displayed: “CARL-WEDGE” and “TEMP ALERT NODE-2.” He frowned.<br> “Sorry, Alisa. Time to wrap this up. I’m calling us a car.”<br> 
“What happened?”<br> 
“It’s the emergency alert system. This notification—it only comes to me. It’s from Carl… Akira’s lab.”<br> 
He pocketed the device, set his laptop on the table, and stood up. Connecting to the local VPN, he accessed the lab’s monitoring logs through a backdoor he’d set up in advance—but the sensors had already gone silent.<br> 
“…The alert came too late. Power lines are down. Smoke, temperature spike, internal access detected… Not good.” He set his glass down and rose to his feet.<br> 
“Syd… what are you going to do?”<br>
“From San Jose? Not much—not fast enough. The alert should’ve already gone to 911, but I’ll call it in myself. Akira might still be inside. Let’s go.”</p>


<p>As Akira was scorched by the intense heat, he heard his name amidst human screams.<br>
The flames, having consumed the oxygen in the second-floor machine room, writhed and undulated like snakes.<br>
Gasping from pain in his chest and side, Akira inhaled the black smoke and coughed violently. The hot air further seared his already burned throat, causing him to curl up at the base of the lab's iron staircase like a fetus.<br>
(…Why did this happen… Was what Sid said true?)<br>
He recalled his conversation with Jessica as she was leaving:<br>
"Akira, it looks like the training is about to finish. Are you working overtime again today? …Don't overdo it."<br>
"Thanks. Well, it seems it'll take more time. I'll do the backup tomorrow."<br>
With his trembling left hand, he reached for his chest and confirmed the presence of the notebook beneath his blood- and sweat-soaked shirt.<br>
(I can't… breathe—)<br>
The fire crawled along the walls to the first-floor floor, rapidly spreading. Batteries exploded, scattering sparks, igniting the heated sofa, cables, and everything else.<br>
Akira struggled to rise, coughing and groaning in pain. Thudding sounds reverberated through the floor, accompanied by a man's deep shouts reaching his ears.<br>
(Put out the fire… the data… the training just finished… please)<br>
Gasping for oxygen, Akira's nose bled into his mouth, causing him to choke. Enduring the excruciating pain, he used one arm to crawl forward. At that moment, high-pressure water from the firefighters' hoses poured onto his back. White steam rose with a hiss. From the mix of white and black steam, two figures emerged, pointing at Akira and shouting as they approached.<br>
Two firefighters knelt beside Akira's body, saying, "You did well! Let's get you out!" They lifted his drenched body.<br>
"The HDD… the fire… please extinguish it," Akira managed to say through the pain.<br>
"Leave it to us! We'll definitely put it out! Hang in there, sir! Stay conscious!" they replied.<br>
Carried out and laid on the asphalt, Akira was surrounded by paramedics. One quickly palpated his chest, noting, "Depression in the right thoracic cage. Pain during respiration… possible rib fracture," then leaned close to Akira's mouth.<br>
"Sir, can you tell me your name?"<br>
Akira strained to respond, "I, …A…"<br>
"Akira… Akira Arato."<br>
"Akira? Mr. Akira Arato!" Akira nodded.<br>
"Oxygen mask! Saturation is dropping," a paramedic with an oxygen tank placed a mask over Akira's face. "Decreased breath sounds on the right side. Suspected pneumothorax," he reported.<br>
"Understood! We'll tell her, hang in there! …Alright, let's transport! Hurry, hurry!"<br>
"Confirm with Valley Medical Center! Burns, multiple rib fractures, suspected pneumothorax, progressing respiratory failure! Can they accept the patient… Hey, he's trying to say something."
On the stretcher, Akira extended a trembling hand. "Please…" he whispered beneath the mask into the paramedic's ear.<br>
"Understood! We'll tell her, hang in there! …Alright, let's transport! Hurry, hurry!"<br>
"Cover… open the cover… to Emi…"
"Control, Medic 74, heading to Valley Medical Center. Secure emergency lanes!"<br>
The driver shouted over the radio, and the ambulance accelerated towards Highway 101 with sirens blaring. Inside the swaying vehicle, a paramedic skillfully cut away the sooty clothing with scissors.<br>
"Suspected fractures from the third to the seventh right ribs. Signs of flail chest. Muscle tissue damage extending to the abdomen. Significantly reduced breath sounds on the right side…" he assessed with a stethoscope.<br>
"Hmm? This is—a leather item. It's adhered to the patient's skin. Securing as personal property."<br>
He gently removed the blood- and fluid-stained leather notebook from Akira's abdomen and placed it on the instrument tray.<br>
"Akira! Take a deep breath," the paramedic continued his careful examination. "Breathing suppressed due to rib fractures. Saturation at 90%, decreasing."<br>
He secured an intravenous line. "Administering analgesics. Alright, full open on lactated Ringer's solution. …Pain from fractures is causing shallow breathing. …Akira, breathe as deeply as you can!"<br>
The sound of breathing through the mask echoed inside the vehicle. Wrapped in a sheet after his clothes were removed, Akira, drifting in and out of consciousness from the intense pain, focused on images projected in his mind.<br>
—That day, we passed a young couple pushing a baby stroller. Yes, and she smiled at the baby. After seeing them off, I spoke to her.<br><br>
"Highway 101 is congested! Diverting to Lawrence Expressway! Twelve minutes to Valley Medical Center!"<br>
Avoiding the still-crowded main roads due to Thanksgiving return traffic, the ambulance turned right. Amidst the persistent monitor alarms, the paramedic continued treatment.<br>
"Saturation down to 85%. Signs of increasing intrathoracic pressure, possible progression to tension pneumothorax," he said, placing the stethoscope on Akira's chest. "Prepare for chest puncture set."<br>
—"If we ever have a child in the future," I said…<br>
Akira's pain-distorted expression softened slightly. The relentless monitor alarms echoed inside the vehicle.<br>
"Blood pressure dropping rapidly! 80, no, 70 over 40! Signs of circulatory shock due to intrathoracic bleeding from fractures and hypoxia…!"<br>
—She widened her eyes and looked at me intently.<br>
"ECG shows arrhythmia… Akira! Hold my hand!" The paramedic quickly prepared a defibrillator while monitoring.
—I looked into her eyes and said,<br>
"Don't lose consciousness, Akira! Stay with me!" the paramedic called out, his hands working without pause.<br>
—“No, I mean… just if. If we ever did… what if we named them Makoto?”<br>
"Jugular vein is distending… prepping for thoracic puncture!"<br>
The ambulance swerved sharply, and the IV bag swung into the air.<br>
—She looked at me, about to cry… then gave a troubled little smile and leaned into me, saying nothing.<br>
The monitor let out a sharp alarm, and the paramedic’s eyes tensed—he was alone in the back.<br>
"Hypoxia, chest trauma complications… abnormal ECG—ventricular fibrillation. Code blue! Damn it, I <br>have to keep him alive till we reach Valley!"<br>
At that moment, Akira began to cough violently. Bright red splattered inside the oxygen mask<br>
"Lung hemorrhage—airway must stay open! Dammit, it’s the chest!"<br>
Straddling Akira’s torso, the paramedic pressed his hands against his chest, voice resolute.<br>
—I held her close and whispered…<br>
"Priority is resuscitation. Here we go—Akira, stay with me! Three… two… one!"<br>
</p>—*Emi… I’m home.*</p>
