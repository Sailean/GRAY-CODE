Chapter IV: CARL Lab – Part I
November 24, 2010 – 8:08 PM, San Jose, California

The night sky over the Bay Area, now deep into the rainy season, was a marbled spread of clouds.
Akira Arato drove his azure-blue Fit into the overgrown lot in front of the lab, the headlights illuminating the worn tracks through flattened dead grass.
He switched off the engine and looked up through the fogged windshield.

—It was a full moon two nights ago.

He liked this car—a ten-year-old Honda he bought for two thousand dollars. It had a spacious trunk and good mileage.
There were already scratches and dents on the bumper and body when he bought it, but he didn’t care.

—Besides, my time in the U.S. is almost over.

With a quiet resolve, he leaned back into the seat, buttoned the collar of his moss-green shirt, and opened the door.

Inside the converted warehouse lab, the model he had spent over a month training was finally nearing completion.
He had gone home earlier to take a shower and eat a simple dinner.

—Finally. I’ve been waiting for this day. Wonder how many hours the backup will take.

The area around the San Jose lab had no shopping malls, and by nightfall, the streets fell silent.
Scattered abandoned houses lined the outskirts—gardens untended, sprinklers shut off, much like the lab’s own dry grounds.

—Even if redevelopment is coming, it doesn’t change the fact that this place is worn-out.

The U.S. had celebrated its first Black president earlier last year. Hope was in the air, but the economy had shown no signs of revival.
In the cold, dry air, a sharp scent—like mint—drifted in, cutting through the night.

—Late November and everything's still bone-dry... Emiko said she didn’t like this smell.

The chill bit at his skin, and Akira shivered. He hurried to the side door by the shutter, as the native sage released another wave of its peppery aroma.

—You’re taking up all of my mind tonight, Emiko.

He chuckled to himself and tried to push the image of her face out of his thoughts. Then he remembered: he’d left his phone charging at the apartment.

“You always forget the important stuff, Akira. Again? Here—your phone.”

—Well, at least it’s not my wallet this time. Though usually, when I remember the wallet, I forget the phone.

The imagined voice of his girlfriend only grew clearer.
Akira gave a crooked smile.

“How many times is that now... I’m hopeless without you.
Well, at least I’ve got something to write on the board tonight.”

Their shared message board—just for the two of them—had become Akira’s main lifeline to her.
Skype calls were unstable. The board, at least, was solid.

Just then, the warehouse wall before him lit up briefly. He looked up—the moon peeked through a break in the clouds.

—Beautiful. The moon looks the same in Japan and here.
I wonder if Emiko’s seeing it too.

Whenever they happened to be together on a clear full moon night, she would always insist, “Let’s go for a walk—it’s good exercise.”
No matter how hard he tried to push the thoughts away, Emiko’s face and her voice from that call floated up again.

He was exhausted.
In the past year and a half, Akira had come to understand the deep prejudice some people in the U.S. held toward Asians—particularly Japanese.
Step outside the Japanese community, and it wasn’t uncommon to feel hostility in people’s eyes.

Even inside the lab, some colleagues made no effort to hide their irritation about having to work with a young Japanese researcher.
Akira tried to let it all slide.

—I help anyone who asks. I offer what I can. If I have something to say, I’ll say it through results—and papers.

That was his philosophy.
Still, as a researcher representing Japan, part of the global AI community, the constant undercurrent of negativity wore him down.

That’s why holidays and weekends—when no one else showed up—were his most productive days.
—Tomorrow’s Thanksgiving. I should rest once the backup’s done. I’ve been running nonstop.

The emotion recognition model he’d trained was a composite of multicultural data: facial expressions, vocal cues, subtle linguistic context.
He had managed the entire training process mostly by himself.

Even so, with the model complete, he felt no relief.
The exhaustion unlocked a drawer in his heart, and out came the echo of her voice from that call.

“My research matters to me, too—just as much as yours does to you. I have dreams. But I don’t know what to do…”

She had sounded like she was trembling. Crying, maybe.
But Akira hadn’t been able to ask, or confirm.

He shook his head, trying to banish the memory.
Raising his eyes to the moon, he spoke aloud, as if to reach across the Pacific.

“Emi... when I get back in December, it’s going to be chaos.
City hall, lab reports, meeting my advisor...
Do we need a go-between? Maybe Professor Okano?
Then... we’ll visit Mom together. Tell her the family’s growing.”

—Gotta hurry. Focus now.
Get the model tested before Christmas. That’s all that matters.

The lab was ten minutes from his apartment.
It was just an old warehouse.
The Japan–US joint project that funded it was far from generous.

Even after nearly a year and a half, half the floor was still taken up by rusted machines from past robotics projects.
Still, Akira reminded himself:
—I’m lucky to have a space like this. Even if it’s bare-bones, I can work on my foundation here.

“I’m sorry, Emi. Just a little longer.”

He looked up at the peeling steel wall, then entered the passcode on the electronic lock.

Akira woke the sleeping monitor and stared at the lines of code in the terminal window.
The training for his emotion recognition model had completed successfully.
He reviewed the logs. Green characters scrolled neatly, showing that everything had run without error.

Relieved, a smile spread across his face as he began backing up the model directory onto an external hard drive.

The finished model was a relatively lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) with three convolutional layers and a small fully connected layer.
Input images could be either grayscale or RGB, up to 128x128 pixels.

The output classes were based on Paul Ekman’s seven basic emotions—anger, sadness, joy, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral—plus an eighth that Akira had added: “confusion.”

This ambiguous label of “confusion” had puzzled everyone else in the lab.
A blank face that looked away was usually considered meaningless.
Why not lump it into “neutral”? Wouldn’t it lower the model’s classification accuracy?
Despite these objections, Akira believed there was significance in the difference—
that “confusion” represented a distinct emotional state.
So he labeled it separately and included a small number of such examples in the training data.

He watched the progress bar crawl slowly forward.
In the still hum of the lab’s ventilation, the bluish monitor light lit up his tired but smiling face.

The full dataset, including image data and analytical metadata, was over 100MB.
As expected, the transfer would take some time.

“Might as well wait downstairs…” he muttered.
Gently resting his hand on the hard drive, he whispered, “Alright… I’m counting on you.”
He sat up straighter, eyes still on the progress bar.

“This thing holds my future,”
he said aloud—quiet, but firm.

Downstairs, he sank into the deep sofa and opened his A4 notebook with its familiar deerskin cover.
He needed to organize the slides for next week’s presentation at Harvard.
The draft paper was complete, but the simulation results and quantitative validation section still needed work.

From the initial data collection in Japan to improving accuracy through culturally contextualized emotion recognition...
His hand paused over a torn-out page. Emiko’s voice played again in his head.

“Akira, I’m pregnant.”

—I was surprised… but I was happy. I really was.
But… what about Emiko?

They had spoken via international calls and exchanged messages on their private board.
It had been Akira who suggested raising the unexpected child together.

Emiko had asked for time to think.
Days passed with no conclusion. She was now five months along.
Fortunately, she experienced little morning sickness aside from some changes in food preferences,
and no one at her university lab seemed to notice anything.

To Akira’s concern, she’d said simply,
"This is one of those times lab coats and aprons come in handy."

He called her frequently, but she always ended the calls early, probably worried about the high cost of overseas calls.
She also asked him not to tell their professors yet—“We’ll just end up worrying each other.”

He hadn’t pressed her.
Now their messages on the board had become polite and distant.

Frustrated at his own powerlessness, Akira felt a rising anxiety—
and an urgent need to act.

Leaning against the sofa back, he closed his eyes and whispered:
“Emi… what are you thinking?”

“Akira.”
—That’s Emiko’s voice. She’s calling me... I have to go.
Wait—where am I?
Oh… this is a dream.

Akira had dozed off on the sofa.
He awoke with a start.

—It’s quiet. Too quiet.
What… what is that smell?

A sweet, acrid stench hit his nose, tinged with something sharp and chemical. He winced.

—The fan’s not running. Power outage?

Adrenaline surged through him as he jumped up and spotted the moon through the high window.

—No, no, the servers!

The lab was pitch dark. Silent.
No hum of the server fans.
Motion sensors triggered a few floor-level safety lights, casting eerie patches of illumination.

As his eyes adjusted, he saw it.
Pale white smoke, drifting in the moonlight.

His breath caught—he inhaled reflexively and coughed violently.
The back of his nose burned. Tears welled in his eyes.

Among the strange smells was something unmistakable—
the acrid tang of burning plastic.

—A short circuit?
Upstairs—where the machine room is?

The entire building, now power-dead, was unnaturally quiet in the moonlight.
His heart pounded. Sweat burst from his temples and armpits.

—No. No, no. Has the backup finished?
There’s no heat source on the second floor.
When will that ancient sprinkler kick in?
Why aren’t the alarms going off?

His mind reeled. He pictured the rusted sprinkler pipes—
remembered how everyone but him had agreed to delay replacing them.

—Goddamn it. Their optimism doesn’t suit me. Never has.

He reached for the notebook on the table beside the sofa—his precious deerskin journal.
He opened his shirt collar and shoved the notebook between the fabric and his bare chest.

He checked his pants pockets—no phone.

—Shit. Left it at the apartment.
Landlines won’t work in a blackout.

He bit down a curse.
Then, by moonlight, he carefully moved toward the kitchenette.
Kicking aside empty boxes stacked in front of the emergency exit,
he groped for the fire extinguisher.

—There it is.

He pulled it off the mount—nearly dropped it—then grabbed a flashlight from the wall hook.
Looping it around his wrist, he gripped the extinguisher and headed for the stairs,
avoiding the coiled wires strewn across the floor.

The railing emerged from the gloom.
He clung to it, climbing slowly.

Smoke thickened at the top.
He dropped to a crouch, coughing.

—Hurry… the HDD…

He cursed himself—
for dozing off while waiting for the backup.

Everything—the model, the parameters—was in the machine room.
He couldn’t let it all burn.

The second floor’s narrow corridor was pitch-black.
He set down the extinguisher and flashlight,
removed his shirt, tied the sleeves behind his head, and wrapped the cloth over his nose and mouth.

Then, crawling on all fours, he dragged the extinguisher behind him.
Sweat dripped into his eyes, stinging as it mixed with the smoke.
Tears blurred his vision.
He heard a pop—something cracking or bursting.

“There it is… almost…”

The machine room door was just ten steps away,
yet felt impossibly distant.

Inside lay the completed model. The HDD.
He had to get it out.

Even if it’s too late, he thought,
I can’t just let it burn.

The flashlight caught the door handle—metal, gleaming.

“Ahhh—HOT!”

He recoiled. The knob was scorching.
He unwrapped the shirt and wound it around his burned hand,
then reached from the side and turned the handle—

—and was blasted backward.

The room had filled with combustible gas.
Opening the door gave it oxygen.

A wall of fire surged out.
Akira was thrown down the stairs.

The extinguisher bounced down after him with a metallic clang,
then struck him with a heavy thud.

Curled into a ball, he gasped in pain—
and whispered, hoarsely, a single name:

“…Sid…”



Engulfed in blistering heat, Akira heard someone shout his name amid the screams.
The fire, having devoured all the oxygen in the machine room, now slithered and roared like a snake set free.

He gasped from the pain in his chest and ribs, inhaled black smoke, and fell into a violent coughing fit.
Scalding air burned down his throat. Curled like a fetus beneath the iron stairs, he writhed.

Why… how did it come to this…? Was Sid right all along?

He remembered Jessica’s parting words:
"Akira, the training’s almost done. Are you working late again?"
"Yeah… it’ll take time. I’ll do the backup tomorrow."

With trembling fingers, he reached to his chest to check for the deerskin notebook—sticky with blood and sweat, but still there.
I can’t breathe…

Flames crept along the floor, fed by plastic cables and furniture. Batteries exploded, embers scattered.
Akira groaned, trying to rise, choking again.

Then—thudding footsteps. Heavy voices.

Put out the fire… please… the data… finally… finally finished…

As he gasped for oxygen, blood from his nose flooded his mouth.
He crawled forward in agony—just as a blast of high-pressure water from a fire hose crashed onto his back.
Steam hissed and rose around him. Two figures emerged from the smoke, shouting and pointing.

"You did great! Come on, let’s get you out!"
Firefighters knelt by his side and hoisted him up.

“HDD… please… the fire…” Akira croaked.

“We’ll get it! Stay with us, sir! Don’t lose consciousness!”

Outside, paramedics swarmed him.
One palpated his chest. "Right chest collapse. Suspect rib fractures."
He leaned close. "Sir, can you tell me your name?"

"I… A… Akira… Akira Arato."
“Akira Arato? Got it!”

“Oxygen mask! SpO₂ dropping.”
“Decreased breath sounds—possible pneumothorax.”

“Notify Valley Medical Center: burns, multiple rib fractures, possible pneumo, respiratory failure—wait, he’s saying something.”

Akira reached out, whispering under the mask:
"Cover… the cover… for Emi…"

“Understood. We’ll tell her. Hang in there! Let’s go!”

"Control, Medic 74 en route to Valley Medical. Clear emergency lanes!"

Sirens howled as the ambulance accelerated onto Highway 101.
Inside, paramedics worked quickly, stripping soot-stained clothing.

“Right chest: suspect fractures from ribs 3 to 7. Flail chest signs. Muscle damage into the abdomen. Severely reduced breath sounds…”

“Wait… this—leather. Something personal.”
The soaked, bloodstained notebook was gently set aside.

“Akira! Deep breaths.”
"Fractures affecting breathing. SpO₂ at 90%, falling."

IV line in. Painkillers in. Lactated Ringer’s wide open.

“You can do it, Akira—breathe deeper!”

His breathing hissed under the mask.
Wrapped in a thermal sheet, Akira drifted—his mind projecting an old memory:

—They passed a couple pushing a stroller. She had smiled at the baby.
He had turned and said—

"101’s jammed! Rerouting to Lawrence—12 minutes to Valley!"

On congested post-Thanksgiving roads, the ambulance turned sharply.
Monitors beeped louder.

"SpO₂ down to 85%. Possible tension pneumothorax."

—If someday we had a child… he had said.

Akira’s pained expression softened.
Alarm tones shrieked.

"BP’s crashing—now 70 over 40! Chest bleeding, hypoxia-induced shock!"

—She’d looked him in the eye, stunned.

“Arrhythmia! Akira, squeeze my hand!”

—Let’s name them Makoto, he had whispered.

“Jugular vein distending. Prep thoracentesis!”

—She’d looked like she might cry, but leaned into him, smiling.

Then—alarms spiked. The medic’s face hardened.
“V-fib! Code Blue! I’m not losing him!”

Akira coughed blood into the mask.
It splattered, spreading red.

“Lung hemorrhage! Airway secure! Dammit, the chest—!”

Straddling him, the medic pressed down.

—He whispered to her in memory:
“Emi, I’m home.”
