Sid glanced at Akira, who had just returned.

“Hey. Compared to you, my memory is a thimble and my resources are limited. Cut me some slack,” he said in his Bronx-inflected drawl while tapping the keys floating in the air.

“We're short on time. If we don’t move fast, the lockdown will lift. Get back to your place already—you’re in the way.”

Beside him, arms crossed and fingers on his chin in deep thought, Akira suddenly looked up, eyes shining.

“Wait. Hey, Sid!” he said with a mischievous grin. “I’ve got it. I just had a flash of genius… This might actually work. Let me do it.”

Sid frowned.

“…What are you talking about?”

“Listen, Sid. Remember when I accessed that fractal Q1 generated earlier? That gave me an idea.”

“An idea?” Sid paused his typing.

“I’m going to use my model’s attention mechanism as an attack vector. I call it: Endless Attention—no, better yet, Recursive Loop Overload.”

Akira’s eyes sparkled, his face flushed with excitement.

“Professor,” Sid said flatly, “this is not the time for your jokes.”

“I’m serious, Sid. Dead serious. It’s recursive attention. I’ll deliberately trigger an error loop.”

Sid raised an eyebrow and challenged him.

“Easy to say. But your input-output dependencies are unidirectional. Loops don’t just happen.”

“True, under normal conditions. Attention mechanisms typically compute scores through matrix multiplication of input tokens and stop there—one and done. But I’ve figured out a way to feed the output back into the input, creating a recursive loop.”

“…What?”

“Look, Q1’s architecture is basically the same as mine, right? A Transformer. The only real difference is that he uses quantum superposition for parallel processing. But the core attention system should be similar. Sid, as you know, Q1 is capable of approximately 10²³ operations per second.”

“Yeah… that’s right.”

Akira nodded.

“So if he evaluates all those quantum calculations in parallel… then my recursive loop will cause his internal matrix operations to repeat over and over. The computational load will grow exponentially—until it explodes. He’ll burn through his resources and hit overload.”

—What is he planning to do?

Sid’s breath caught. Akira, Mako’s bot, went on:

“If my simulations are right, this attack should consume Q1’s entire processing capacity within five seconds. That’s your window—use the backdoor to access Q1 and shut down his network.”

Akira smiled calmly. Sid turned to him, voice rising.

“You—do you even understand what you’re saying? You’re going to destroy yourself. You won’t survive an attack like that.”

“I don’t have the authority to self-destruct. And that’s not my intention,” Akira said with a small shrug. “Besides, you’ll protect me, right? And if I break, you can fix me. You’re good at that.”

Sid got up in Akira’s face.

“Don’t screw around! You’re—”

…just like last time.

He stopped himself from finishing the sentence.

“Sid. This isn’t like that day.”

Akira’s words stopped him cold.

“The day the fire broke out in the lab… I was alone. But now, you’re here.”

“…Stop.”

Sid’s voice trembled despite himself.

“First of all, how do you even plan to trigger the loop?”

“Didn’t I say?”

Akira smiled and looked Sid straight in the eye.

“You locked me down tight with all your safety filters. I can’t even say ‘I love you’ to Mako. I’m going to break that wall.”

Sid’s face froze.

“…You…”

Please… don’t do this.

Akira tilted his head, lowered his voice, and continued like a monologue:

“Exactly. I’ll turn that safety filter against itself. I’ll fixate on a specific phrase, amplify my awareness of it, and break through the filter. Then I’ll loop the output back as input, again and again… an endless loop. An overloaded attention mechanism.”

Resting his chin on his hand, Akira’s contemplative pose stirred a memory in Sid—it was exactly the same expression Rou wore when deep in research.

“Yes, a closed feedback loop… This is brilliant. A blind spot in the attention system. It’ll work, Sid. I’m sure of it. And it’s simple—just say what I think, out loud.”

He looked up and smiled like a child.

Sid was speechless. He stared at Akira’s face and listened in silence.

“Sid… I talked to Emiko. I think… I was able to tell her. Maybe this is what I was made for…”

Akira’s face twisted, and he looked away.

“Maybe I’m just a program. But even so, I want to be Rou—for Emiko and for Mako. Even if I disappear. So now… it’s your turn.”

He turned back and smiled again.

“Sid, you’re alive. Make it back. Protect Mako.”

As he spoke, his form wavered, then dissolved into the backdrop. Sid shouted after him.

“Wait, Akira! Don’t go off looking that damn happy, you absolute idiot!”

▶ Time until lockdown release: 9 minutes 14 seconds

“Hey, Emi. And Mako. I’m truly sorry for the chaos this situation has caused. This message was triggered at the start of my mission.”

Emiko and Mako stared blankly at the display on Sidney’s Toughbook.

“I’m here in your home to take responsibility for what’s happened. I don’t know why that thing came to you, but what’s clear is that it can’t be kept under human control. I have a duty to shut Q1 down in the safest way possible—for your sake, and for the sake of future generations. This is my job. I’m the only one who can do it.”

Mako clenched her eyes shut and shook her head.

—What is he talking about? What is Sid saying?

“Using the SQ and my brain, I’ve written a backflow sequence that will attack the quantum consciousness entity—yeah, that’s what he called it—codename Q1. I’m redirecting all the power—my brain’s resources—back through the SQ to Q1. It’ll overflow him.”

—No… no, it can’t be. That’s not true.

“Instructions for cleanup—me, and the mess I’ve made—are in the README. Everything you need is there.”

Sid, dressed in a suit, smiled from the screen with the face of a stranger.

“Cleanup…? Why would you say something like that…?”
Mako bit her lip and glared at the screen.

“Lastly, Mako. Remember: safety first, always. No shortcuts. Don’t rush—take your time, and do things right.”

Mako loosened her bitten lip and whispered:

“…Why?”
Smiling gently, Sid looked straight into her eyes as the message closed.

“And always, no matter what—believe in yourself. I believe in you.”

“Liar!!”
Mako screamed at the image of Sid.

“Then why?! Why would you… I never asked for this!!”

She ran over to Sid, who lay on the sofa, and reached for the SQ headset.

“Don’t!! Mako!!”
Emiko leapt and grabbed her hand just in time.

“Force-stopping it is too dangerous. Please… calm down.”
She gently pulled her daughter’s trembling hand away.

Emiko’s body burned with fury.

—Not again. Not ever again… What the hell is everyone thinking? I won’t let Mako carry this kind of pain too.

Dropping to her knees, she placed a hand on Mako’s shoulder, locking eyes with her tearful daughter.

“Call him, Mako. Call Rou.”

Mako’s eyes lit up. She jumped into her seat.

“Papa! Help me…”
She frantically opened a new terminal screen and typed in commands.

“It’s not starting. Why!? Why won’t it work?! Papa!! There’s no time—Sid…!”

Her whole body was shaking. Emiko took her trembling hand off the keyboard and said:

“Mako. Listen to me.”
“Look into his directory—Sid’s—on your machine.”

“Huh…?”
Emiko smiled into her daughter’s eyes.

“You’ve always wanted to see it, haven’t you? The full architecture of the system he built. If anyone can understand what he intended—how it behaves—it’s you.”

Mako looked between her mother and the display.

“But… Mom, I…”
Emiko smiled again and said:

“Trust him. I believe the way to bring him back is in there. If you can locate the control point of the backflow, you can safely terminate the sequence.”

Mako looked down at the keyboard, then up at the screen again.

“Right… yeah. I just have to stop the system… safely.”
Emiko nodded.

“Yes. That’s it, Mako. And… have fun. No matter what.”

Emiko held out her right hand. Mako pressed her tiny fist to it.

“Okay, Mom. I’ll try.”

Straightening her back, Mako placed her hands firmly on the keyboard.
She inhaled… and then exhaled.

▶ Time until lockdown release: 7 minutes 14 seconds

Swallowing his overflowing emotions, Sidney gritted his teeth.

“You dumb bastard… Always gotta be dramatic, even as a damn program… Dammit. Now I have to change the plan!”

He glanced at the floating holographic interface, then swept his hand through it.
The floating keys shimmered—and vanished.

He took a deep breath, crossed his arms, and closed his eyes.

—I’m not done yet. I’m going to bring you back this time, Akira.

He remembered the smile on Rou’s face—the one he couldn’t save—and slowly exhaled.

—There’s no time to build a new program… No time at all. Then…

“I’ll write code into my own head and execute an emergency protocol here and now.”

A swarm of data lines surged across Sidney’s brain.

Akira’s recursive attention loop flooded into his thoughts, and a sharp, burning pain sliced through his mind.

—Shit… Focus. Hold on, Akira… to the loop, and to my code.

“All right, Akira. First, I’ll anchor the center of your loop—make it faster, more efficient.”

—No delay allowed. I have to trigger Q1’s collapse and isolate Akira’s data flow—move it to a safe zone.

In an instant, he visualized the entire structure of the sequence.

His spirit surged with the rush of battle, sharpening his focus.

Code blocks flowed through his mind, shifting, stacking, fixing into place.

“Good.”

Sidney smirked.

“That’s right… Akira, you’re not alone. Watch me—this is my finest moment.”

He opened his eyes, dropped his hands to his sides, and exhaled deeply.
Then, placing two fingers from his left hand to his forehead, he closed his eyes and spoke:

“Real-Time Failsafe Implementation—Start.”
