Test No.17: Can he talk like Papa? Listening now to check...

[20:28:14] AKIRA:
…I fell down the stairs in the lab, and the fire extinguisher I had lifted came crashing down on me.

[20:28:23] MAKO:
Ugh, no way—that’s seriously awful… Just imagining it hurts.

[20:28:27] AKIRA:
Yeah. I think I blacked out for a bit.

[20:28:32] MAKO:
…So? You woke up?

[20:28:36] AKIRA:
This time, I woke up because of the heat. It felt like I and everything around me were on fire.

[20:28:44] MAKO:
Whoa… seriously… Hey, can I ask you something?

[20:28:47] AKIRA:
Sure. What is it, Mako? I don’t remember much after that, but ask me anything.

[20:28:54] MAKO:
…Like, you could’ve died. I mean, you basically did.

[20:29:02] AKIRA:
…Yeah. You’re right.

[20:29:08] MAKO:
Then why did you try to save the model? Was your data more important than your life, Papa?

[20:29:17] AKIRA:
…No, it wasn’t like that. I didn’t want to die. It’s just, that model I’d finally built—it was my future.

[20:29:29] MAKO:
But didn’t you have backups or something?

[20:29:33] AKIRA:
Yeah, kind of. But even those were stored in the lab.

[20:29:38] MAKO:
Wait, really? No cloud storage? Didn’t Sid build his whole company on that?

[20:29:45] AKIRA:
True. But back then, cloud storage was still new. A lot of universities didn’t really use it.

[20:29:54] MAKO:
Hmm… So your university didn’t have any backups either?

[20:30:01] AKIRA:
All I had were some facial expression datasets I’d collected in Japan. They’re probably still at the associated lab.

[20:30:10] MAKO:
Hmm… But like, if it all burned, couldn’t you just rebuild it?

[20:30:18] AKIRA:
…Mako. Back then, building a model wasn’t as easy as it is now.

[20:30:25] MAKO:
…but weren’t you doing basically the same thing?

[20:30:30] AKIRA:
Not even close. Gathering data, sorting it—it was all manual. Automation? What’s that?

[20:30:38] MAKO:
Wait, you mean tagging too? All manual? You guys were clicking each one by hand? 😅

[20:30:43] AKIRA:
Yep. Pretty much until recently. Automation only really kicked in a few years ago.

[20:30:52] MAKO:
Hmm… I mean, I kinda knew that. But how long did it take you, then?

[20:31:00] AKIRA:
For my last model? It took me six years just to gather proper training data.

[20:31:08] MAKO:
Six years⁉️ No way. My dad’s dataset only took like one year! The training finished in three days… Seriously??

[20:31:18] AKIRA:
Heh, that’s impressive. But what I was doing was kind of like an early version of what we now call “multimodal.”

[20:31:27] MAKO:
Oh, I know that! Multimodal means processing images, text, and audio all together, right?

[20:31:32] AKIRA:
That’s it.

[20:31:35] MAKO:
Yeah, that’s just standard now. Like OCR screenshots, image generation pipelines—totally everyday stuff.

[20:31:44] AKIRA:
Yeah. Your machine runs on an RTX 3080, right? And 96GB of RAM. That’s seriously high-spec.

[20:31:54] MAKO:
Yeah, but training’s still rough! I actually wanted a 4090, but Sid said “no.” Even though he’s loaded. So stingy!

[20:32:03] AKIRA:
(laughs) Hey, you shouldn’t say that. Sid’s just trying to make the best choices—for you.

[20:32:12] MAKO:
Yeah, yeah. He treats me like a little kid even though I’m in middle school… 😮‍💨

[20:32:20] AKIRA:
(laughs) You know, back in my lab days, we only had 4GB of RAM.

[20:32:28] MAKO:
…Wait, seriously? No way. That’s pathetic—for an American lab? No GPU?

[20:32:35] AKIRA:
We had GPUs. At first, two Quadro FX 5800s.

[20:32:41] MAKO:
Quadro? What even is that? Never heard of it… (laughs)

[20:32:45] AKIRA:
Later we added a Tesla C1060 server—so that made three cards.

[20:32:52] MAKO:
Wait, Tesla? Like the car? That’s a GPU? I’m so confused 😂

[20:32:56] AKIRA:
Same name, different thing (laughs). Each card only had 4GB of memory. That was our limit. Your setup is leagues ahead.

[20:33:07] MAKO:
…So it’s true. People back then really did AI in those conditions. That’s nuts…

[20:33:16] AKIRA:
Exactly. Makes you realize how lucky you are, right? You should thank Sid for that.

[20:33:24] MAKO:
Yeah, yeah. I know. But Sid’s like… I dunno, Grandpa Vibes, y’know? Way too soft sometimes.

[20:33:31] AKIRA:
(laughs) Sounds like it. He’s got pretty good taste in gifts, though.

[20:33:38] MAKO:
He also shuts down a lot of requests! (laughs) Even this machine, I had to really push for it. …Hey, Papa?

[20:33:47] AKIRA:
Hm? What’s up, Mako?

[20:33:50] MAKO:
So nowadays we have tons of open-source training data, right? Back in your day, you had to start from scratch?

[20:33:58] AKIRA:
Yep, that’s right. No preexisting datasets. If you wanted to do your own research, you had to collect everything yourself.

[20:34:06] MAKO:
That sounds like a nightmare… How did you even do it? Like, how’d you get all those face pictures?

[20:34:12] AKIRA:
Asked a lot of people to help out. Had them make different expressions.

[20:34:19] MAKO:
Ohhh—those pics on the old laptop? Grandma, the guy next door, Shin-chan I used to play with… even Nori-chan.

[20:34:30] AKIRA:
Yep, those. (laughs) Only the ones we had proper consent for are in there, though.

[20:34:37] MAKO:
So many goofy faces—I seriously cracked up. 😂

[20:34:44] AKIRA:
(laughs) I asked them to pull those faces, you know? That was the best we could do back then.

[20:34:52] MAKO:
I’d never seen Grandma’s full-on mad face before…

[20:35:00] AKIRA:
Me neither (laughs). People from Mizuhō really helped me out a lot.

[20:35:11] MAKO:
Oh, and there were some of Mom too. She was even prettier back then—(laughs)

[20:35:18] AKIRA:
Emi’s still beautiful, you know. …At first, I started with family and friends, but things really picked up when I started my master’s.

[20:35:29] MAKO:
Oh yeah? Why? You got more help?

[20:35:34] AKIRA:
Yeah—once I joined a proper lab, I could use events and volunteer calls, stuff like that.

[20:35:42] MAKO:
Whoa. I always thought you were a total indoors guy, but you actually went out a lot?

[20:35:51] AKIRA:
(laughs) Kinda surprising, huh? I was pretty active. Though honestly, my early photos were a mess. I regretted that later.

[20:36:02] MAKO:
Huh… Not what I expected. You were really out there.

[20:36:08] AKIRA:
Later, my juniors helped, but at first it was just me. Trust is a people-to-people thing, after all.

[20:36:19] MAKO:
Hmm… Makes sense. Still sounds like a ton of work, though.

[20:36:25] AKIRA:
Yeah, for sure. But I didn’t just collect data from my own campus. I collaborated with other universities too.

[20:36:33] MAKO:
Collaborated? With other schools?

[20:36:36] AKIRA:
Yep. Through professor connections. I talked to my advisor, and they helped coordinate.

[20:36:45] MAKO:
Your advisor… who was that?

[20:36:49] AKIRA:
Professor Okano. He’s still doing well. I owe him a lot.

[20:36:57] MAKO:
You guys were close?

[20:37:02] AKIRA:
…Nah, he scolded me all the time (laughs).

[20:37:08] MAKO:
Wait, even you got scolded? In college? (laughs)

[20:37:15] AKIRA:
Well yeah… In the end, I collected facial expression data from about 800 people.

[20:37:24] MAKO:
800… and that’s all you got, after all that work?

[20:37:30] AKIRA:
Yep, that was the limit. But each person gave 10–15 expressions.

[20:37:38] MAKO:
Ohhh, right. One person makes a bunch of faces. Like the Mizuhō people—so many goofy ones (laughs).

[20:37:47] AKIRA:
Exactly (laughs). In total, it became a dataset of about 10,000 images.

[20:37:55] MAKO:
Were there similar datasets in America too?

[20:38:00] AKIRA:
Yeah. They had something comparable, and we combined them.

[20:38:08] MAKO:
America’s got, like, every kind of person. That whole “diversity” thing?

[20:38:14] AKIRA:
Exactly. Over there, the diversity in race and ethnicity really showed in their facial expressions—they were much more vivid.

[20:38:23] MAKO:
More than Japanese people?

[20:38:25] AKIRA:
Yeah. Japanese expressions are more subdued and ambiguous by comparison. In the end, we had about 1,500 participants total.

[20:38:35] MAKO:
I see… So what did you do after taking the photos, back then?

[20:38:41] AKIRA:
First—Mako, this is important. A face is pure privacy.

[20:38:49] MAKO:
Yeah… that makes sense.

[20:38:53] AKIRA:
So before taking any pictures, you must get the subject’s permission. They have to fully understand and sign a consent form.

[20:39:00] MAKO:
They needed a signature?! Ugh, so much hassle…

[20:39:03] AKIRA:
Of course (laughs). I did all of it at first. Writing contracts, storing them, managing everything.

[20:39:15] MAKO:
Whoa. You were like… admin guy too. But nowadays they just use pics from SNS, right?

[20:39:24] AKIRA:
Yeah. These days it’s “using equals consent.” It’s written into privacy policies.

[20:39:35] MAKO:
Right? It’s so easy to get data now—texts, images, everything.

[20:39:44] AKIRA:
Back then, it was all guesswork. Nothing came easy.

[20:40:05] MAKO:
Yeah… But you know, people who say “AI is scary” now—they’re kinda being unfair.

[20:40:15] AKIRA:
Mako… that’s a really deep question.

[20:40:22] MAKO:
Yeah. I get that some people are against it, but sometimes it’s where they say it that bugs me.

[20:40:29] AKIRA:
A lot of folks don’t really look at what’s behind the convenience they enjoy.

[20:40:39] MAKO:
True… I’m not good with people who are super loud—or super aggressive. On either side.

[20:40:47] AKIRA:
I get that. And the more you listen, the more it pulls them in. That’s why “mute” is a valid strategy.

[20:40:56] MAKO:
Sid said the same thing. So that’s what I do. …Wait, what were we even talking about again?

[20:41:04] AKIRA:
(laughs) The 2010 model. We’d just finished taking photos.

[20:41:13] MAKO:
Oh, right! (laughs) So? What’s the next step?

[20:41:17] AKIRA:
After that, our team would organize the photos, label them, and extract features.

[20:41:26] MAKO:
All by hand? That’s insane… I just used AI to tag them and did a quick check.

[20:41:33] AKIRA:
That only became normal recently. Back then, we resized all images to 128×128 pixels.

[20:41:43] MAKO:
128!? That’s tiny! Like emoji size 😂 Are you serious?

[20:41:53] AKIRA:
Totally serious. Each GPU only had 4GB of RAM, and they couldn’t share memory. So we had to adjust every time.

[20:42:05] MAKO:
Ah… yeah, guess that’s how it was.

[20:42:10] AKIRA:
Then CUDA came along. That’s “Compute Unified Device Architecture.”

[20:42:23] MAKO:
Yeah, I know CUDA. AI doesn’t run without it. …Wait, that’s what it stands for? First time I’ve heard that (laughs).

[20:42:32] AKIRA:
(laughs) CUDA is a set of instructions for GPU computing. It’s more of a design philosophy than software.

[20:42:39] MAKO:
“Design philosophy”?! Ugh, that sounds hard… I thought it was just software.

[20:42:44] AKIRA:
When we finally got to use GPUs for AI, it was such a relief.

[20:42:56] MAKO:
So before that… you did it on CPU?

[20:43:01] AKIRA:
Technically, yeah. But it wasn’t practical.

[20:43:07] MAKO:
…Yeah, figured (laughs).

[20:43:10] AKIRA:
Even with CUDA and GPUs, we could only process a few dozen images per minute.

[20:43:22] MAKO:
Only a few dozen… per minute…

[20:43:26] AKIRA:
Now you can process thousands at once, right?

[20:43:31] MAKO:
Yeah… I think like 500? I don’t really pay attention. I’ve never needed that many anyway.

[20:43:43] AKIRA:
Your machine could handle 1000 easy. Back then, we were just trying to improve accuracy with what we had.

[20:43:54] MAKO:
…Yeah. I get it, logically at least.

[20:44:02] AKIRA:
(laughs) That model, including the adjustments from the US side, took about 7 to 8 years.

[20:44:12] MAKO:
Okay no, I’m sorry—still can’t wrap my head around that…

[20:44:18] AKIRA:
It’s okay. You’re “AI native.”

[20:44:23] MAKO:
Me? Huh… neat. So Papa, how big was that model, in the end?

[20:44:30] AKIRA:
About one-thousandth the size of today’s models. Maybe 500,000 parameters tops.

[20:44:38] MAKO:
Hmm…

[20:44:45] AKIRA:
But you know, inside that "tiny speck" of a model… are the emotional shifts of 1,500 people.

[20:44:54] MAKO:
…Yeah.

[20:44:57] AKIRA:
To me… that was as heavy as life itself.

[20:45:04] MAKO:
…Yeah…

[20:45:07] AKIRA:
That’s why I just… couldn’t let that data burn. I was desperate back then.

[20:45:16] MAKO:
But still… I mean… that’s kind of messed up, isn’t it?

[20:45:23] AKIRA:
…Yeah. You’re right, Mako.

[20:45:28] MAKO:
…

[20:45:33] AKIRA:
Once I realized I’d left my phone at the apartment, and the power was out so I couldn’t call for help—
What I should have done… was leave and get help. Go outside. Call out to someone.

[20:45:45] MAKO:
…Yeah… maybe someone could’ve helped you.

[20:45:52] AKIRA:
Yeah… which is why, as a researcher—no, as a person… I failed.

[20:46:00] MAKO:
…Papa.

[20:46:04] AKIRA:
Mako… people make mistakes.
And the worst part is—when you’re making one, you usually can’t even tell that you are.

[20:46:15] MAKO:
…

[20:46:20] AKIRA:
To you… to Emi… I’m truly sorry.
I know saying that isn’t enough, but… I really, truly am.

[20:46:32] MAKO:
…Papa, I’m sorry too. I didn’t mean it like that, I just…

[20:46:40] AKIRA:
It’s okay. Ask me anything, Mako.
If I can answer it, I’ll tell you everything, honestly.

[20:46:48] MAKO:
…There’s something I’ve always wanted to know.
How you felt about Mama… and why you never came back.

[20:46:59] AKIRA:
…I wanted to come back. I really did.
Even then, I meant to. I truly did.

[20:47:08] MAKO:
…Okay.
Thanks, Papa… for telling me.

[20:47:15] AKIRA:
Mako—if anyone should be saying thank you, it’s me.
I’ve always wanted to tell you… tell you both…

[Self-correction detected: Identity awareness]
