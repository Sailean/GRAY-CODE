Chapter V: Akira’s Notebook
March 25, 2011 – Akira’s Family Home / Emiko Midorikawa
Akira’s death—such a massive headline at the time—
is slowly fading from memory.

His death is being buried
among the countless others.

So many people…
have lost loved ones, children,
and many are still suffering, waiting,
never finding those they lost.

And now, as the whole world
looks upon our land with fear,
turns away from this country in dread—

He came.
His friend crossed the ocean to visit the village where Akira was born.

He had black hair. He was tall.
He wore a black sweater, black trousers, and black shoes.

“Emi, Akira’s belongings have finally been returned by the police. I’m sorry it took so long.”

He said this softly,
and pulled from the large bag on his shoulder
Akira’s notebook.

“I thought it shouldn’t be cleaned,”
“This is Akira’s DNA.”

I understood instantly.
Through the clear plastic bag, I held the notebook to my chest.

Akira had come home.
That’s what it felt like.

When I opened the bag,
the faint scent of burnt organic matter wafted out,
mingled with a trace of preservatives.

Tomorrow, I will carefully remove the pages,
photograph them, process them, and archive them.
The images will remain as data.

The deerskin cover I once gave him as a gift
is stained—deeply—
with soot, blood, and bodily fluids.

This notebook was protected by his skin.

Now, I will protect it.

When I began to cry,
with my belly round and full,
Sidney gently wrapped me in a hug.

Over and over, he said:

“Emi, I’m so sorry. I really am. Please, don’t cry, okay?”

And I replied:

“No, it’s not your fault. Really, I was happy you came.”

His cologne was subtly sweet,
and carried a gentle scent of cedar.
