Chapter XV – Epilogue: Christmas in Matsumoto
December 25, 2024 – Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture
Emiko Midorikawa

In the early hours of the 22nd, just after midnight, Sidney quietly departed in the car that had come to pick him up.

We still don’t know what “Q1” really was, or why it had come here.
Neither Makoto nor I asked him.

The video message Sidney had intended to leave, and the actions he took, left deep scars on our hearts.
They won’t heal easily.
And when I saw his face, silent as he watched the logs replay on the screen, I somehow knew—we shouldn’t ask.

Sidney took Makoto’s entire machine back to America.
Regarding her now-dormant bot, he told me, “I’ve backed it up. I’ll be in touch, I promise.”

To my surprise, Makoto didn’t seem concerned about it at all.
In fact, she seemed excited about the new desktop Sidney promised to send her.
She said she would use it to work on restoring Rō’s old notebook.

During her winter break, Makoto retrieved a letter Rō had written fourteen years ago and stored in the G3.
It was written in code.

The variables were cryptic and strange, and the date of my birthday—December 25th—was embedded in the logic.
I tried desperately to read it, calculating each number…
But I couldn’t solve the cipher.
Frustrated, I eventually crumpled the letter and threw it to the floor.

Makoto, startled by my emotional outburst, gently said:
“It’s okay, Mama. I’ll try decoding it.”

And she did.
In no time at all, she cracked the message that had completely stumped me.

Her eyes sparkled as she proudly revealed the decoded result, puffing out her chest like a little lion.
“For the first time—I beat you, Mama!”

The code was simply a numeric substitution for letters… just a basic alphabetic encoding.
She had probably used an AI to help.

And looking at her face, I couldn’t help but burst out laughing.

At the same time, the decoded message made me irrationally angry.

I shouted: “What an idiot!”

Why didn’t you say those words while you were still alive?
Why did you go and make things so roundabout?
Why… did you have to die?

As I cried those words out loud, I broke down and wept.

Makoto rubbed my back and kept whispering, over and over,
“It’s okay, Mama. Please don’t cry, okay?”

And as I listened to her, I remembered Rō’s voice from inside the screen:
“Don’t cry, Emi.”

And I remembered his eyes—the way he had looked at me.

There was a small box beside the letter, tucked into the empty drive bay.
Inside was a delicate ring shaped like a fern—my favorite.

Just on a whim, I opened the old G3 with a vintage version of Python installed.
I typed out the code and executed it.

None I failed
And beneath that, Makoto’s decoded line:

Decoded (from encoded values): “SORRY. LOVE. TRY.”  
…I want to see you again.

Even if it’s only your bot, I want to see Rō again.
I want to talk with you—just once more.

That’s what I thought.
