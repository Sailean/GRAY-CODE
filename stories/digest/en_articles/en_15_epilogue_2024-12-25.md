Chapter XV – Epilogue: Christmas in Matsumoto
December 25, 2024 – Matsumoto City, Nagano Prefecture

<p>In the early hours of the 22nd, just after midnight, Sidney quietly left in a waiting car.<br>
We still don’t know what that “Q1” really was—or why he came here at all.<br>
Neither Makoto nor I asked.<br>
The video message he tried to leave behind, and the actions that followed, left a wound in our hearts.<br>
One that will not heal easily.<br>
And as I watched his face, silent while staring at the logs, I felt we were not meant to ask.</p>
<p>Sidney took Makoto’s machine back to the States in its entirety.<br>
Regarding her bot—which had stopped functioning—he told me,<br>
“I’ve backed it up. I’ll be in touch, I promise.”<br>
To my surprise, Makoto didn’t seem to care at all.<br>
In fact, she looked forward to the new desktop Sidney had promised to send her.<br>
She said she’d use it to continue restoring Akira’s old notebook.<br>
Inside the G3, which she opened over winter break, we found a letter from Akira—written 14 years ago.<br>
It was entirely in code.</p>

<pre class="uk-pre uk-margin-medium"><code>
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

def relationship_equation(true_value, regret, special_date):

    try:
        key_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(special_date, "%Y-%m-%d")
        day_code = key_date.day * key_date.month 

        love_coefficient = (12 * 15) + (22 * 5)  
        regret_factor = (19 * 15) + (18 * 25)  
        result = true_value * (love_coefficient - regret) / (1 + day_code)

        if result <= 0:
            raise ValueError("Critical computation failed")
        return result, "I tried"

    except ValueError:
        secret_message = u"".join([unichr(x) for x in [87, 105, 108, 108, 32, 121, 111, 117, 32,

        sys.stderr.write(u"\nERROR: %s\n" % secret_message)
        return None, "I failed" 
        

special_date = "2010-12-25" 
true_value = 1          
regret = 300      

result, message = relationship_equation(true_value, regret, special_date)

print result, message</code></pre>


<p>He’d used suspiciously meaningful variables, and the date—December 25th, my birthday.<br>
I read the code desperately, calculating the numbers over and over again.<br>
But I couldn’t crack the message.<br>
In frustration, I crumpled the letter and threw it on the floor.<br>
Makoto, startled by my reaction, said gently,<br>
“It’s okay, Mama. I’ll try to decode it.”<br>
And she did.<br>
With glittering eyes, she shared the result with pride, puffing up her chest.<br>
“I beat you for the first time, Mama!”<br>
The cipher was just a simple alphabetical encoding.<br>
She probably used an AI.<br>
Looking at her face, I burst out laughing.<br>
And then, all at once, I felt an overwhelming anger rise up.<br>
“Honestly… what a fool!” I shouted.</p>

<p>Why didn’t he say it when he was alive?<br>
Why take such a long way around?<br>
Why… did he have to die?<br>
Why… why… I cried out, and the tears came in torrents.<br>
Makoto rubbed my back gently, whispering,<br>
“It’s okay, Mama. Don’t cry… please don’t.”<br>
As I heard her voice, I remembered Akira’s own voice from the screen—<br>
“Don’t cry, Emi.”<br>
And the way he used to look at me.</p>

<p>Inside the now-empty bay, along with the letter, was a small box.<br>
Inside it lay a beautiful ring, shaped like a fern—my favorite.<br>
Just in case, I typed the code again into the G3,<br>
the one that still ran an old version of Python.</p>

<p>I want to see you.</p>
<p>Even if it’s just a bot—I want to see Akira.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you again.</p>
<p>That’s how I feel.</p>
