## Chapter I. Welcome Home
Emiko climbed the apartment stairs, a heavy grocery bag hanging from each hand. Without pausing, she tilted her head and wiped the sweat from her brow onto the shoulder of her shirt.

Still just June, and it’s already this hot... I should’ve bought more beer.

At the door, she shifted both bags to one hand and fished out the key chained to her jeans. Just as she slid it into the lock, the door swung open from inside.

“—!”

Startled, she took a step back and nearly stumbled. But when she caught a glimpse of her lover’s face through the gap, she smiled.

“You’re back early. Welcome home. You scared me.”

“Emi... I’m home. Sorry, I just got in myself. Here, let me take those.”

Akira took the grocery bags from her hands and stepped over his large suitcase, a suit jacket draped across it, making his way down the narrow hall.

“Thanks,” Emiko said, picking up his jacket and suitcase, chuckling as she followed.

Akira paused and turned with a puzzled look. “Hmm? What is it, Emi?”

Emiko smiled. “These are heavier.”

“Ah—sorry. My laptop’s in there... You could’ve just left it.”

“It was faster to carry it than step over it. So? How was the conference?”

“Still a pretty niche field, but everyone’s working hard. I got some new ideas—it was invigorating.”

He placed the groceries on the small table next to the bed, peeked into one of the bags, and let out a delighted exclamation.

“Oh! Eggs! Finally, tamago kake gohan! Are you making rice?”

Emiko laughed. “You’ve been going on about it nonstop—of course I am. Tonight or tomorrow morning, help yourself. The rest is just simple stuff though.”

Pulling out the ingredients and lining them up on the table, Akira said, “No way. This is a feast for me. The tofu isn’t frozen, and the veggies are fresh. Looks great—I could eat it raw. Nice.”

“So no nasty questions, just good vibes at the Q&A? That’s a relief.” Emiko placed his bag down and picked up his jacket.

“Well, not nasty exactly... but there were some sharp critiques, as always. Still, that’s how you learn. Honestly, it was fun.”

Hanging his jacket on a hanger, Emiko wrinkled her nose at the sweat. “Yeah, I get it... I’ll take this to the cleaners. Wear your spare tomorrow, okay? Mind if I check the pockets?”

“Thanks. Kyushu was crazy hot. Feels cool here though. Like I’m alive again.”

She had returned from her university earlier, switched on the AC, and gone shopping. “Yeah... summer’s already here. Humid, too.”

Pulling a few folded papers from his jacket pocket, Emiko blinked. “Wait—this is my paper! You peer-reviewed me?”

Akira gave a sheepish grin. “Of course not. I read it on the plane. It’s fascinating—gene networks, huh? I’ve been thinking about it nonstop.”

“I see,” Emiko smiled, then changed the topic. “So, how’s San Jose this year? Cooler than Tokyo, right?”

While speaking, she placed the beer cans in the fridge.

“The humidity’s low as ever, so it’s easier in the shade. Still bone-dry year-round, and the fires... same as always.”

Turning around, she saw Akira now in just his underwear, having tossed his shirt and pants on the bed.

“Want one? It’s a bit warm, though,” Emiko asked, holding up a beer can.

“Sounds great, but I’ll shower first. Emi, let me help later. We could’ve eaten out—you didn’t have to cook.”

“At least eat properly while you’re in Japan,” Emiko said, smiling.

I bought ice... I’ll make a quick salad first, then...

As she mentally assembled the night’s menu, Emiko tucked the perishables into the fridge and left the rest on the counter.

The beer got warm on the way back. Should probably freeze it, save the ice.

“Hey, Akira—” She turned, only to be caught suddenly in his arms.

“Sorry. I couldn’t wait.”

His scent. It hasn’t changed. That’s right... I remember now.

She became suddenly conscious of her own sweat and shifted in his embrace. Akira’s arms loosened slightly, and Emiko looked up into his face.

“I need a shower too. I’m all sticky...” Her sentence was cut short by Akira’s lips pressing against hers. Emiko closed her eyes and pulled him closer.

The time they’d been apart had felt long. But the moment she touched him, his warmth seemed to erase the void. Emiko wrapped her arms around his back and held him tight.

Their lips parted, and Akira murmured into her hair, “Let’s shower together.”

Looking up, their eyes met. Emiko whispered, “Akira... did you buy them?”

“Of course. Fresh from the store.”

Emiko burst into laughter.

Fresh condoms...?

It was funnier coming from the ever-serious Akira, who couldn’t joke to save his life.

Still... it’s a relief. They degrade over time. And today... is ovulation day.

Before Akira left for the States, Emiko had been on low-dose birth control. But without insurance coverage, the expensive pills had long fallen off her routine. Every time he came home, her anxiety returned.

If I’d just gotten a new prescription... If I’d restarted a month ago, just for tonight...

Pressed against her cheek, the unfamiliar detergent scent on his shirt mixed with his own nostalgic smell. It brought their long separation into stark relief. Her heart pounded; her body buzzed with happiness—but her mind retreated elsewhere.

Too late now... to think about that.

She kept her swirling unease to herself and simply nodded. “You’re right.”
