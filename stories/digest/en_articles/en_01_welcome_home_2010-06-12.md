<p>Emiko trudged up the stairs to their apartment, a grocery bag swinging from each hand.<br>
She didn’t slow down, just tilted her head and wiped the sweat from her forehead onto her shoulder.<br>
<span class="voice-in">June’s barely started, and it’s already this hot? I should’ve grabbed more beer.</span><br>
At the door, she shifted both bags to one hand and fished out the key from her jeans pocket.<br>
Just as she slid it into the lock, the door creaked open—from the inside.<br>
“—!”<br>
Startled, she stepped back and nearly lost her balance.But then she saw the familiar face peeking through the gap—and broke into a smile.<br>
“You’re back already? Welcome home. You scared me.”<br>
“Emi... I just got here. Sorry. Let me take those.”<br>
Akira took the bags from her hands, stepped over his bulky suitcase—with his suit jacket draped over it—and disappeared into the narrow hallway.“Thanks,” Emiko said, picking up his jacket and bag. The soft-zip travel bag was just big enough for a laptop, shirts, and a week’s worth of conference notes.<br>
She chuckled softly and followed.Akira paused, turning with a curious look.<br>
“Hmm? What’s funny?”<br>
She grinned. “This is heavier than the groceries.”<br>
“Ah—yeah, sorry. Laptop’s in there. You could’ve just left it.”<br>
“Easier to carry it in than trip over it. So—how was the conference?”<br>
Akira nodded as he walked.<br>
“Still a niche field, but people are working hard. I got some new ideas. It really energized me.”<br>
He set the groceries down by the bed and peeked into one of the bags.<br>
“Oh—eggs! Finally! I can have tamago kake gohan again. Are you making rice?”<br>
Emiko laughed. “I figured you'd want that. Of course I’m making rice. Tonight or tomorrow—your choice. Everything else is pretty basic though.”<br>
As he began pulling out ingredients and laying them on the table, Akira said,<br>
“No way—this is a feast. Tofu’s fresh, not frozen. These veggies look amazing. I could eat them raw. This is perfect.”<br>
“So no nasty questions, just good vibes at the Q&amp;A? That’s a relief.”<br>
Emiko placed his bag down and picked up the jacket.<br>
“Well, not nasty exactly... but there were some sharp critiques, as always. Still, that’s how you learn. Honestly, it was fun.”<br>
She hung the jacket on a hanger and wrinkled her nose.<br>
“I’ve seen how much you put into this. That kind of work—most people never notice. But they did. And you deserve every bit of it.”<br>
She glanced at him, softening.<br>
She wrinkled her nose again at the sweat lingering in his jacket.<br>
“Let me send this to the cleaners. Wear your spare one tomorrow, okay? Mind if I check the pockets?”<br>
“Thanks. Kyushu was crazy hot. Feels cool here though. Like I’m alive again.”<br>
Emiko had gone home from campus earlier just to switch on the A/C before heading out to shop.<br>
“Yeah... summer’s already here. Humid too...”<br>
She reached into the jacket pocket and pulled out a few folded papers.<br>
Then blinked. “Wait—this is my paper. Akira, did you peer-review me?”<br>He gave a sheepish grin.<br>
“Peer-review? You kidding? I wouldn’t survive page one. But honestly, it was fascinating—I read the whole thing on the flight. That gene network stuff stuck with me.”<br>
Emiko gave a knowing smile and shifted the subject.<br>
“Oh, Akira… I was kidding. But… thank you. That means a lot. So... how’s San Jose this year? Cooler than here, right?”<br>
She placed the beer into the fridge as they talked.<br>
“The humidity’s still low, so it’s manageable if you stay in the shade.<br>
Still dry as ever. Wildfires are becoming the norm now.”<br>
When she turned around, Emiko saw that Akira had already tossed his shirt and pants onto the bed.<br>
He stood there in just his underwear, casually stretching.<br>
“Want a beer? It’s a bit warm now,” she asked, holding up a can with a small smile.<br>
“Sounds great. But I’ll take a shower first.”<br>
He grabbed a T-shirt and switched the A/C to cool with the remote. “Let me help with dinner later, okay? You didn’t have to cook—I mean, we could’ve eaten out.”<br>
Emiko laughed. “At least eat properly while you’re in Japan. Tonight, it’s on me.”<br>
She mentally mapped out the evening menu—start with a quick salad, then...<br>
While sorting the groceries, she tucked the perishables into the fridge and left the rest by the sink.<br>
<span class="voice-in">Ugh, the beer warmed up on the way home... I want to save the ice, maybe I should toss this one in the freezer...</span><br>
“Hey, Akira—”<br>
She turned around—and was suddenly wrapped in his arms.<br>
“Sorry,” he whispered. “I couldn’t wait.”<br>
His scent hit her all at once.<br>
It hadn’t changed. And just like that, the memories came flooding back.<br>
Emiko suddenly felt self-conscious about her own sweat. She shifted slightly in his embrace.<br>
Akira loosened his grip, and she twisted around to look up at him.<br>
“I need a shower too. I’m... kind of gross.”<br>
But her words were cut off as Akira kissed her.<br>
She closed her eyes and pulled him in tighter.<br>
All the time they’d been apart—so long, and yet, in his warmth, it melted away in an instant.<br>
She wrapped her arms around his back and held on tightly.<br>
Their lips parted, and Akira murmured into her hair, “Let’s shower together.”<<br>
Emiko met his eyes and whispered, “Akira... did you buy them?”<br>
“Of course. Fresh from the store.”<br>
She burst into laughter.<br>
<span class="voice-in">Fresh? Condoms? Really?</span><br>
Coming from ever-serious Akira, it was hilariously out of character—and therefore, even funnier.<br>
But at the same time... it was a relief.<br>
<span class="voice-in">They degrade. And today of all days... is ovulation day.</span><br>
Before he left for the States, she’d been on low-dose pills. But they were expensive without insurance, and she’d stopped long ago.<br>
Whenever he came back, the same anxiety returned.<br>
<span class="voice-in">If I’d just started again a month ago, maybe I wouldn’t be thinking about this now...</span><br>
The detergent scent on his shirt was unfamiliar—something foreign, mixed in with the nostalgic scent she knew by heart.<br>
Her heart pounded. Her body buzzed with happiness... but her thoughts slipped somewhere else.<br>
<span class="voice-in">Too late now. No point thinking about it.</span><br>
She said nothing of the anxiety swirling in her chest, and simply nodded.<br>
“You’re right.”</p>

<p class="uk-text-center uk-margin-medium-top">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="uk-margin-medium-top">“Sorry, Akira. It kind of froze.”<br>
Still wrapped in a towel, hair dripping, Emiko pinched the cold beer can between her fingers as she pulled it from the freezer.<br>
“It’ll thaw fast.”<br>
Akira slipped into a T-shirt, flipped the A/C to cool mode, and smiled at her. “Emi, go get dressed. I’ll help finish up in here.”<br>
“Tempting to just wrap this in a towel and wear it around my neck,” he added, eyeing the frosty can.<br>
“Ultimate heat cure. Go for it,” Emiko laughed, placing the can on the little table.<br>
“No, wait... wrapping it in a towel would insulate it. My heat wouldn’t transfer efficiently.”<br>
Akira was now staring at the beer like it was a lab sample.<br>
“The fastest way is direct contact—maximum surface area means maximum conductivity.”<br>
Emiko sighed and smiled, shaking her head.<br>
“Akira, stop. This isn’t a conference. No one here needs a thermodynamics lecture. Just leave it on the table like a normal person.”<br>
She walked off toward the bathroom, still giggling.<br>
Through the mirror, she caught a glimpse of Akira holding the can to his forehead, then his neck—flinching each time as the icy metal shocked his skin.</p>

<p class="uk-text-center uk-margin-medium-top">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="uk-margin-medium-top">“Approach? What kind of approach?”<br>
Emiko stood over the boiling pot and asked without looking up.<br>
She dipped thin slices of pork into the broth with chopsticks, letting them swirl before lifting them out.<br>
“Ah—sorry. I meant my approach to modeling emotion.”<br>
Akira mixed shredded cabbage, lettuce, and arugula with a pair of tongs as he spoke.<br>
“If we can combine more types of quantifiable data, then maybe we can model how emotions shift over time.In fact,... the more ambiguous people <span class="uk-text-emphasis uk-text-bold">think</span> emotions are, the more likely there's some underlying pattern.”<br>
He paused, then added, “That’s the idea, anyway...”<br>
“Patterns, huh... So it all starts with theory, after all.”<br>
Emiko transferred the blanched meat into ice water to cool.<br>
“Put this on the salad, will you?”<br>
She laid the drained pork on paper towels and pulled a jar of homemade dressing from the fridge.<br>
“Well, yeah. Everything starts with a theory. Then—wait, did you say something?”<br>
Akira looked up mid-mix, confused.<br>
“This pork here—” she gestured toward the meat, then shifted her gaze to the salad still in his hands.<br>
“Goes <span class="uk-text-emphasis uk-text-bold">on</span> that salad you’ve been mixing non-stop.”<br>
She picked up a bowl of halved cherry tomatoes and handed it to him.<br>
“And these too.”<br>
Akira took the bowl instinctively.<br>
Emiko continued as she rinsed the pot, her tone soft but pointed.<br>
“You know, Akira... there’s a lot you can’t discover unless you actually try it out.<br>
Sometimes the best theories come from accidental findings.”<br>
“Sure,” Akira nodded, tossing a tomato into his mouth. “But even in chaos, there are rules. That’s my job—to find them.”<br>
He chewed thoughtfully, then started plating the salad, topping it with the chilled pork.<br>
“Emotion seems messy. But I think there are hidden rules, invisible patterns.”<br>
His certainty made Emiko pause.<br>
She admired his confidence—and felt a twinge of envy stab quietly in her chest.<br>
“You’re really sure of yourself, huh.”<br>
<span class="voice-in">How can he chase his theories so directly, without hesitation?</span><br>
She thought about her days in the lab—running repetitive experiments, staring into Petri dishes where nothing ever seemed to appear the way it should.<br>
Fragments of stressed plants, gene traces that refused to show up, contaminants slipping through despite every precaution...<br>
<span class="uk-text-emphasis uk-text-bold">—I might never find that key gene. Ever.</span><br>
She wrung out a sponge and placed it aside, exhaling quietly.<br>
Akira, still cheerful, lifted another tomato slice.<br>
“That’s why I believe in this. And just like this salad? I already know it’s going to taste amazing—especially with this pork.”
Emiko chuckled.<br>
“That’s dramatic.”<br>
She couldn’t tell if he was joking or just dead serious.<br>
“I’m totally serious,” he grinned.<br>
“Everything you cook is amazing. But since I’ve been in the States? I’ve really come to appreciate it.”<br>
<span class="uk-text-emphasis uk-text-bold">—Then maybe you should just stay here forever...</span><br>
The thought flickered through her mind—but she swallowed it back down.</p>
“...So your contract’s another year, right?”<br>
She set the empty bowl in the sink. “You’re coming back to Japan... right?”<br>
“Yeah. That’s the plan.”<br>
Akira glanced down, thoughtful. “Sid invited me to join Nexus, but... I’ve still got things I want to do here.”<br>
Emiko let out a quiet breath. Her gaze dropped.<br>
“I saw that. He mentioned it on the mailing list.”<br>
She hesitated, then added, “Still, it’s impressive. Q-Nexus in Sidney’s no joke.”<br>
“He keeps a low profile, but yeah—he’s legit. But I want to go back to the university.”<br>
Akira began plating the salad. “Back to Okano’s lab. I started this research there. I want to finish it properly.”<br>
“Back when it launched, Okano said, ‘I want this lab to be a place where you can research freely.’”<br>
He topped the salad with pork slices. “I was the first grad student there. It’s grown a lot since then, but that’s not why I want to go back.”<br>
He looked up, distant for a moment.<br>
“I want to create something that understands emotion—and connects people. I think that’s possible. And that lab... it’s the closest place to it.”<br>
Emiko said nothing.<br>
She carried the empty bowl to the sink and turned on the water.<br>
“Sid told me, ‘Your research needs the environment I can give you.’”<br>
Akira laughed quietly. “Sounds like him, right?”<br>
“Yeah. It comes through clearly in the list too.”<br>
Emiko smiled faintly. “He used to be in the military, didn’t he? That explains the... intensity.”</p>
“He was a signal officer, yeah. Knows everything about communications. Super helpful. And strong—really strong. I want you to meet him sometime.”<br>
Akira seemed about to say more—but went quiet.<br>
Emiko turned her head slightly. “What?”<br>
He looked up, like he was trying to find the right words.<br>
“My theory... it only exists because I was here. In Japan. So I want to finish it here.”<br>
Then his nose twitched.<br>
“Wait. Emiko, is something... burning?”<br>
“Huh?”<br>
She whipped around. “—Oh no!!”<br>
She lunged for the grill tray.<br>
The thick slices of deep-fried tofu were covered in tomato sauce and cheese—beautifully baked.<br>
But the finely chopped green onions on top were now thoroughly blackened.<br>
“I meant to check on it... and completely forgot.”<br>
She pressed a hand to her forehead, sighing in defeat.<br>
Akira peeked over her shoulder.<br>
“I like it a little burnt. Let’s eat it anyway.”<br>
He gave her a warm grin.</p>

<p class="uk-text-center uk-margin-medium-top">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="uk-margin-medium-top">Breathless murmurs filled the tiny bedroom, muffled as if in deference to the paper-thin apartment walls.<br>
The dim orange glow of a side lamp shimmered on Emiko’s damp forehead.<br>
Akira watched her profile, her hand pressed against her lips.<br>
He raised his left hand, brushing away the bangs clinging to her skin.<br>
He began analyzing her expression.<br>
<span class="voice-in">Averted gaze. Furrowed brow. Tension lines. Tightly shut eyes... All signs say: No.</span><br>
But another voice stirred inside him.<br>
<span class="voice-in">No... Everything else says: Yes.</span><br>
He gently took her hand from her mouth, threading his fingers through her hair.<br>
As her chest rose and fell beneath him, he leaned down and kissed her parted lips.<br>
She responded, arching into the touch, her pale throat catching the light as it bent backward.<br>
“Emi,” he whispered. “What do you want?”<br>
“Say it.”<br>
They tumbled back down onto the bed together.<br>
Emiko trembled. Her voice broke as she whispered, “Akira...”<br>
She reached for him, pulling his head closer.<br>
“Hmm? What is it?”<br>
He met her eyes.<br>
Even now, she thought, even now, his gaze is so... cool.<br>
<span class="voice-in">Is my body the only part of me you need? I can’t see your heart at all.</span><br>
“Switch,” she whispered in his ear.</p>
Akira smiled faintly, slipped his hand beneath her waist, and smoothly reversed their positions.<br>
A breath escaped Emiko’s lips, trembling at the edge of laughter and something else.<br>
“Emi.”<br>
He held her head gently.<br>
“Say it out loud.”<br>
His voice brushed her ear like static, sending a current down her spine.<br>
She arched again, her hair cascading over Akira’s bare chest, sticking slightly to his skin like silk touched by steam.<br>
“Let me hear you,” he murmured—<span class="uk-text-emphasis uk-text-bold">your feelings</span>, he added silently.<br>
She answered in gasps, in tiny cries.<br>
And as if holding something fragile inside himself, Akira closed his eyes.<br>
Their sweat-soaked bodies lay side by side, tangled in silence.<br>
Still catching her breath, Emiko stared up at the apartment ceiling through half-lidded eyes.<br>
<span class="voice-in">Why is human reproduction so deeply tied to emotion? And why...</span><br>
As her thoughts cooled, the familiar question rose up again.<br>
<span class="voice-in">Emotion gets in the way. 
Every time you touch me, I feel like I might overflow.</span><br>
She whispered it again, the mantra buried deep in her heart:<br>
<span class="voice-in">If I can’t speak my feelings... I’d rather not have them at all.</span><br>
Akira’s sweat dripped from above, landing softly on her forehead.<br>
Their eyes met.<br>
A single tear slid down Emiko’s cheek.<br>
<span class="voice-in">You once asked me what the tears meant. And I told you,<br>
“My emotions just... overflowed.”</span><br>
He wiped the tear gently with his finger.<br>
<span class="voice-in">Since then, you stopped asking.</span><br>
And Akira said nothing. Just held her, wordlessly, as she cradled the unspoken in silence.</p>
