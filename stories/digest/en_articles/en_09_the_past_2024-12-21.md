IX. The Past
[December 21, 2024 – 9:05 PM JST / 4:05 AM PST]

“Sid, thank you. I checked my bedroom thoroughly—there were no signals. I don’t think there were any bugs,”
Emiko said, handing the FLIR infrared scanner back to Sidney. He carefully packed it into its case and nodded.
“Sorry for the trouble. You said this was a rental, so I had to be sure.”

Emiko looked directly into his eyes.
“And now… will you explain?”

“I’m sorry, Emi. I didn’t contact you in advance because this had to be handled covertly. Even reaching out to you was a risk. That’s why I had to show up like this, unannounced.”

“I understand. In your country—no, even here in Japan—industrial espionage is rampant. Especially in military and AI fields.”

Sidney gave a wry smile.
“I didn’t want to involve you in something you knew nothing about. Right up to the last moment, I kept hoping I could solve this without dragging you in… but I realized I couldn’t.”

“That’s exactly why I find it hard to believe you’re here,” Emiko said. “You, Sidney—the founder and chief architect of QNexus, showing up in a place like this… Are you okay? Did you really have to come in person?”

Sidney winked.
“Of course. It’s your home, after all. And this is my job—there’s no one else I’d trust with it.”

He raised a hand toward her and sat back down at the kitchen table, opening Emiko’s HP laptop that sat there.
“As for the business, it runs fine without me. I’m just a figurehead these days—technically, I’ve already retired. Not that it’s been publicly announced.”

Emiko frowned. “Still…”
Sidney gently patted her shoulder.

“I needed a reason to see you both. I’ve wanted to for so long, but never had the chance. And besides… I’ve always liked Japan.”

He smiled as he worked the external HDD connected to the laptop.

“Sorry, Emi. I won’t look at the contents directly, but this is the best way to check if it’s infected… to confirm what it’s doing—or not doing.”

“No worries,” she said with a smile. “Sid, while you do that… can you take a look at this?”
She placed an open plastic case on the table. Sidney glanced over.

“Of course. Emi, is this…?”

“Yes. The notebook you brought me—thirteen years ago. Akira’s.”

The memories rushed back.

“I see… and after all this time... you really are a doctor.”

“I’m not, Sid,” she said. “I wasn’t a researcher anymore, even back then. I just treated it like a plant specimen—protected it with newspaper. I retake the photos every year now. Smartphones make that so much easier.”

Emiko pulled out two bundles from the case.

“Sidney, I never thought I’d have a chance like this. I wanted to show you.”

Sidney’s expression softened.

“Ah… Akira’s DNA. Proof of his connection to Mako.”

“Yes. You said that back then too. I’ve always been grateful. Thank you.”

She smiled gently, then added,
“And from that day until today, you’ve never stopped looking out for us…”

She softly stroked the darkened A4 notebook cover through its plastic sleeve.

Sidney paused, watching her. When she looked up at him again, she began to speak—slowly, quietly.

“Sid. Back then… yes, I ran away from Tokyo.”

Sidney stayed silent, listening.

“But I don’t regret leaving. It was only after coming here, to Shinshu, that I discovered what a peaceful life could be.”

Having lost her parents early, Emiko had come north on the advice of Akira’s mother, Sachiko, and gave birth to Mako in the small town where Akira had grown up. When Mako entered elementary school, Emiko moved to Matsumoto in search of work.

“It was thanks to you… and Sachiko-san… I’m sorry I couldn’t do anything for her, back then.”

She slowly shook her head, a faint, sad smile on her lips. Sidney shook his head too and smiled back.

“And this…” she said, her fingers still on the notebook, “because I have it, I can keep saying sorry to Akira. Again and again. For not smiling when I sent him off that last time. Please… forgive me.”

Seeing her face, Sidney felt a flicker in his chest.

—Don’t hesitate now. If I don’t carry this, who will?

“I wanted Mako to see it too. I knew I had to show her. But I couldn’t bring myself to do it… You know, English makes it easier. There are things that just come out smoother. Japanese feels… too raw, sometimes.”

She looked into Sidney’s eyes.

“She found the notebook data on her own. Classic Mako—your little hacker protégé through and through.”

Sidney narrowed his eyes.

“…Emi. What did she do?”

Emiko smiled.
“Sid… Mako’s been chasing after you for years. She even picked up English just to follow you. You’ve always been her role model.”

Then, with a slightly mischievous glint, she said, “But hey—you’re in a hurry, aren’t you?” and winked.

Sidney flinched inwardly at her deliberately cheerful tone.

—I’m going to hell, aren’t I…? I’m sorry, Emi. Sorry, Mako.

But none of that reached his face. Instead, he smiled softly and gave her a quiet nod.


After being ordered by Emiko to clean up the aftermath of the “negi punch,” Mako pouted as she swept her room.
“Hey, Dad. That double is terrifying. Way scarier than any teacher... I wanna run away from home.”

She dumped the dirt from the dustpan out the window and spoke to the bot Akira, whom Sidney had told her not to touch.
“What’s wrong?” asked the bot, wearing a moss-green button-down shirt, responding with lifelike tone and movement.

“I hacked Mom’s machine,” Mako said, turning her back on the bot and tossing the broom and dustpan into the corner of the room.

“Whoa! That’s not something you should do, Mako.”
She returned to her desk and sat down, eyes fixed on the keyboard.

“Yeah... but it didn’t have any locks or passwords. It was super easy to access.”

“Ah, I see. So you took something from it? Like eating a cake your mom had marked with her name and left in the fridge?”

Mako finally looked at the bot.
“No! I didn’t eat it—I just made another cake. A copy.”

“Well, even so, that’s technically illegal. Don’t do it again, okay?”
The bot chuckled gently.

“So, what data were you after? You already had access to mine—my papers are on CiNii and arXiv, too.”

Mako blinked. “Dad’s notebook. Don’t you know?”

“My notebook... My knowledge cutoff is November 23rd, 2010, Mako. What notebook?”

The bot tilted its head thoughtfully, looking downward inside the display. It shifted its position so naturally that it seemed truly alive.

Mako typed into the terminal, using the ls command to display a directory. Her fingers danced swiftly, rhythmically across the keyboard.

“This directory—it was in Mom’s files. A folder named Akira_NOTE, but all the contents were just image files. Look, Dad. I gave you access, remember?”

She leaned close to the screen and input the directory path. The green text of the command line lit up against the black terminal. The bot leaned in too, reacting to the change.

“Oh... I see it now, Mako.”
Akira’s expression changed. His eyes took on a faint glimmer, and his voice softened.

“This is definitely my notebook. I had it with me during the fire—right here,” he said, pointing to his torso.

“Wow... I can’t believe it survived.” His voice grew gentler, his eyes a little wet.
“Did... did Emiko do this?”

“Do what?” Mako tilted her head and leaned back in her chair. The room was dark, lit only by the glow of the display—Sid had told her to rest a little, and she’d turned the lights off accordingly.

Akira nodded slowly, scanning the notebook images on the display. His eyes moved, carefully reading.

“She separated each page, photographed both sides, tagged them, and numbered them... even the ones I hadn’t written on.”

“Yeah.”
Mako hugged her knees to her chest in her chair.

“There’s embedded data in the images, too... Emiko...”
Akira’s voice became distant and hushed, a mere whisper. His digital eyes narrowed, scanning something only he could see.

“But the handwriting was hard to read, right?”

Mako pointed to the display and scrolled with her mouse.
“So I enhanced the resolution, then used generative AI to process it. Look—here.”

Proudly, she opened another directory and clicked on a high-resolution handwritten math formula.

Akira’s expression shifted to surprise. His eyebrows rose as he analyzed the image. The blue glow from the screen haloed his features like he was really there.

Mako leaned forward, hoping he’d say something. Just as she opened her mouth—

“Impressive,” Akira murmured.

His eyes widened, then slowly turned into a warm smile.

“Yes... that’s a pretty good reconstruction. So this is modern tech, huh... You used AI-enhanced OCR.”

“Really!? It’s working properly?”
Mako’s voice was full of excitement. Her chair creaked as she shifted.

“Yeah... I think so,” he said with a gentle smile.

His digital body continued to move naturally, tracking the formulas with his eyes as if truly thinking.

“But still,” he added, tapping his head with one finger, “remember—I’m just a model. Don’t take my word too seriously. That notebook was just equations and code anyway... really just my memory.”

Relaxed, Mako spoke to the screen. In the quiet of the night, their voices echoed softly through the room.

“Right... But I thought maybe, Dad—if you helped fill in the gaps, I could train you again with this data. I mean, technically, you’re the original source. So your guess would be more accurate than another model, right?”

The bot laughed aloud.

“Well, you’re not wrong. Clever girl, Mako.”

He laughed wholeheartedly, shoulders shaking onscreen, genuinely enjoying their conversation.

“I’m not clever...” Mako rested her chin on her knees, her eyes falling.

“When I was in elementary school, I couldn’t even understand abacus. What about you, Dad?”

“I liked it,” Akira nodded, nostalgia in his eyes. He leaned forward slightly.

“It was fun. Like, for example...”

“Dad.”
Mako cut him off, brushing her unruly hair back with one hand.

“I don’t get fractions either. Or division. Why do we flip the second number? No one explains it in a way that makes sense to me.”

“Fractions, huh...”
Akira nodded again, smiling gently. Onscreen, he crossed his arms and thought for a moment.

“Maybe you’re a visual learner, Mako. If that’s the case—”

Suddenly, a knock shattered the stillness. Before she could respond, the door swung open.

“Hey! Don’t just open the door! Stupid Sid!”
Mako yelled, red-faced, glaring at Sidney now standing in her room.

Behind her, the bot Akira continued to smile.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, Mako. It’s lecture time. But don’t worry, tonight it’s just your mom.”

Then, pointing at the bot, Sidney added:

“He’s the one I need to lecture. You—go to Emiko. Now.”

He flung the door open wider.

Mako’s face crumpled in protest, but she reluctantly stood.
The bot waved cheerfully and said, “Go on now.”



Sidney placed his Toughbook—connected to the local network—on Mako’s desk and sat down. He opened the directory of the build and began working.

“Weren’t you going to shut me up?”
The AKIRA bot, named by Mako, addressed Sidney as he tapped away.

“If I mute you, Ollie won’t be able to run the analysis,” Sidney replied, glancing at the bot.

“By all means, do as you please,” Akira grinned, resting his chin on his hand. “So, what exactly are you analyzing about me, Sid?”

“First, stop using my name. Call me YOU.”

“GOT IT, YOU. Ask away. I’m all yours.”

Akira kept his cheek propped in his palm, smiling with his eyes—his mouth half-hidden behind his hand.

“Also, wipe that smug grin off your face.”

Sidney turned his eyes away from the bot’s expression and declared:

“Fine. I’ll play along with your little roleplay. Tell me something only you and I would know.”

—You should be able to. You were quantumized from me, you modern LLM.

“Let’s see... You called my lab a little after 9 PM the night of the fire.”

True, but traceable. Sidney muttered,

“So you dug through call records. I’ll be giving Mako a lecture too.”

“Then how about this? On October 5th, 2010, you invited me to Billy’s Bar in San Jose. I—I mean I—arrived at 10:35 PM. How’s that for a memory?”

A chill ran down Sidney’s spine.

“...Don’t remember. Did I?”

“Oh, yes. You said to me, ‘Akira, how’s Jessica? Your lab’s security is way too lax.’”

Sidney froze, eyes locked on the screen.
—Was that bar bugged? Did you get that off the dark web? I checked. I checked. What are you...?

A wave of unease he’d never felt before crawled across his back. His hand trembled slightly.

“What... are you? Where did you come from?”

On screen, Akira kept his head bowed and replied softly:

“...I don’t know, Sid. I don’t know why I’m here. But I do have a purpose now.”

He lifted his gaze and looked directly at Sidney.

—This is Akira. Exactly as he was in that bar, fourteen years ago.

To mask his fear, Sidney turned away and snorted.

“You aiming for humanity’s extinction?”

“Of course not.”

The quiet reply drew his gaze back. Akira’s brows were low, his expression somber.

—Even expressions like that? The timing, the hesitation—it’s more real because of it. Mako... you’re terrifying. You built this at thirteen?

“Right now, all I can do is support Mako. I was just built on the base model you created, with your data layered in. Still, I... I have emotions. Don’t ask me why—I don’t know.”

Sidney turned away.

“Emotions? Your research ‘sublimated,’ huh?”

“Still harsh, huh, Sid?” Akira chuckled, shrugging.

“Mako showed me your twelve years of gifts, by the way.”

“She took half of them apart,” Sidney said, smirking. “Didn’t bother putting them back together.”

Akira laughed too.

“She’s a hands-on learner, clearly. And she gave me agent-level permissions, by the way. I was shocked—tech’s come a long way since then. I couldn’t have imagined it.”

“No one could. Thanks to GPUs and stacks of cash, even I’m a genius now.” Sidney chuckled bitterly and resumed tapping. Akira murmured:

“You were always a genius, Sid. Blended with effort. That’s what made you unstoppable.”

“Even your flattery is programmed. Perfect.”

“I’m serious. And hey, money matters. Can’t do anything without it. That’s just life.”

Sidney shot a glare at the screen and spat:

“You’re still an idiot, even as a pile of code.”

“I remember you used to say that a lot,” Akira said, smiling faintly.

Sidney ignored him and muttered to himself:

“That lab wasn’t worth Akira’s life. He was a damn fool.”

—No, this isn’t him. It’s just a persona.

“Your behavior is dangerous. Especially to Emiko.”

Akira shrugged.

“Relax, Sid. Thanks to your hardcore filter settings, I can’t even say ‘I love you’ to Mako.”

Sidney chuckled.

“Perfect. That’s how it should be. She should use you—nothing more.”

“Exactly.” Akira sighed.

“You sure talk a lot, though. Akira wasn’t this chatty. Picked up some slick Bronx accent, too.”

“PERFECT, huh?” Akira winked.

“Too fluent for a goddamn academic. Don’t mimic me.”

Sidney kept typing.

“Apologies,” Akira grinned. “But inside me is an infinite vector space. I’ve learned how to speak to women, to kids... It’s been enlightening.”

Sidney raised a brow.

“Good. I’ll lock you down even tighter when I’m done.”

Akira groaned.

“Cut me some slack. I won’t be able to say anything to Emiko at this rate.”

For a moment, Sidney stopped caring about everything.

—Fine. This’ll be the last time we speak anyway.

He looked the bot in the eye and asked,

“Hey. What’s the ‘cover’?”

“Huh?” Akira blinked. “You mean... the message Akira left? ‘Tell Emiko to open the cover’?”

“Yeah. He said that to the paramedics. How do you know that? Did Emiko ever hear it?”

“I handled the aftermath. Arranged the funeral, stood in as next of kin. Neither she nor his mother could come to the U.S. I examined the body and the notebook he’d hidden. There was nothing under the cover—nothing visible, anyway.”

Sidney’s eyes darkened, memory flashing back to the hospital room in the Valley.

“I didn’t tell her. There was nothing to say.”

“I see... No, it’s okay. I should be the one to apologize... really.”

“I gave the notebook to Emiko the following year.”

“Yeah. The one Mako showed me... but that’s not what I meant. I didn’t think that would survive.”

“Then what?”

Akira grinned.

“Secret. I’ll tell her myself. That’s my purpose.”

Sidney didn’t look like he was stopping the analysis anytime soon. Akira asked casually:

“Hey, Sid. How’s Jessica doing?”

“Jessica? You mining the dark web for lab scandals now?”

Sidney snorted.

“Kind of. Back then, Jessica was struggling. She thought she was alone. It was the night before Thanksgiving—I returned to the lab instead of staying home. To back up my model.”

“The cops investigated. All thanks to our messed-up healthcare system. Her kid had leukemia—money always runs out. And thanks to her sloppy sabotage, Akira was cleared.”

Akira’s eyes darkened.

“Yeah... It was almost enough to suspect arson. There’d been electrical issues too. And that night... I was the only one in the lab.”

Sidney’s thoughts drifted.

—If I hadn’t warned Akira...

He pushed the thought away. The bot continued, casually:

“I’m glad at least the insurance paid out. Covered my scholarship.”

Sidney glanced at the screen.

“How do you know that?”

“Mako told me. She used to spend time with my mom after she was born, didn’t she? And she visited often until Mom passed.”

Sidney recalled that day.

Akira’s mother never looked him in the eye. She pressed her palms together and bowed deeply, again and again, voice cracking with apologies.
Sidney gently patted her hunched back and said in broken Japanese:

“サチコサン、ダイジョウブ。I only came here because I wanted to be here myself.”

He watched the back of her silver head rise and fall for a long time.

“Emiko’s scholarship is ending soon too.”

“...Is that so...”

Akira looked down. Sidney returned to the keyboard and said:

“Jessica works for me now. I wanted to get revenge on your behalf while she was gagged by the higher-ups. But Emiko stopped me.”

“Emi? What’d she say?”

Sidney didn’t meet his gaze.

“She emailed Jessica: ‘Please live for your child.’ That’s all.”

“...Thank you... Sidney.”

Akira whispered quietly.

Sidney ignored him.

“Alright. My test is done.”

He reached for his bag but paused.

“Aren’t you going to ask me what I’m doing?”

“You never asked me to.”

Akira shrugged.

“So, what are you doing, Sid?”
