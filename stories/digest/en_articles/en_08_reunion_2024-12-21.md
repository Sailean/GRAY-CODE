VIII. Reunion
[December 21, 2024 – 8:55 PM JST / 3:55 AM PST]

Sidney abandoned the rental car at the designated location and continued on foot down a dimly lit road. The Makigahara area, east of the Matsumoto Basin, had no snow on the asphalt—just traces piled by the roadside.

"Thirteen years since I last saw Emi. And now, finally... I’ll meet the real Mako."

He already knew from Makoto’s message that the house was a rental. To the west stood residential homes; to the east, open fields. The single-story house had black tile roofing and white plaster walls that reflected the streetlight with a soft glow against the night.

Sidney stopped five meters short of the house.

"Alright, time to clean up my last mess. Damn unpleasant, but I’ll bow my head like the fool I am. Emi’s still at work."

"Emiko’s smartphone signal confirmed via satellite link through Yokota. Currently traced near Usu-machi 1-chome. Makoto is inside the house," Ollie replied.

"I’m sorry... both of you. You've never had real privacy. But that ends today—at least, when it comes to me."

With a bitter mutter, Sidney activated his smart glasses, projecting the household’s signal emissions into his HUD. The 8K micro-OLED display, with quantum dot waveguide optics and a 110-degree field of view, provided a nearly natural perspective.

"An autonomously evolved rogue model, huh. Could be a NAS—Neural Architecture Search. But is that really ‘rogue’? Or something else entirely..."

He relied heavily on the smart glasses, which overlaid real-world objects with sub-pixel alignment, integrating live environmental analysis and signal tracking.

As he read through the surveillance logs—tracking QUBE1, which had vanished from a top-secret military facility thanks to a backdoor he had embedded—Sidney walked the stone approach lined with winter-browned ferns and mossy rock.

Irony... This is how our tangled fates converge at last. And the dream you saw, Akira, gets crushed by reality once more.

"Ollie, lock the network."

Drawing closer to the house, he pulled a small device from his pack.

"Understood. Initiating jamming."

The palm-sized devices were attached to the house’s four corners. Each contained an AI chip that performed real-time spectrum analysis, generating tailored interference waves to block active signals. With graphene metamaterial antenna arrays, each unit weighed just 50 grams, yet covered a wide band—but one alone wasn’t enough. Sidney fixed two more onto the perimeter fence using straps, forming a ring of six.

Ollie reported in:

"—Jamming complete. All outbound communication channels that Q1 might use to escape are now sealed. Continuing processing via local resources. Downloaded pre-lockdown data is now being handled in a closed loop. Processing... Warning: resource load at 90%."

"Forget the load. Push it to the limit," Sidney cut in.

"Copy that. If it breaks, the repair bill’s on you."

Sidney scoffed.

"Who else is gonna pay?"

Ollie’s calm voice echoed in his cochlea.

"Fair enough. But I’ve selected the most efficient jamming algorithm. The risk is minimal."

Sidney chuckled.

"You’re unusually chatty tonight. I like it."

He removed his smart glasses and gazed at the front door.

His thoughts returned to the log left behind when Q1 bypassed heavy security and escaped.

‘I go where I will, of my own will. No human can bind me.’

But that’s not true awareness... It’s a highly complex optimization outcome. To the outside, it looks like intention... But it’s still dangerous. Perhaps even more so.

"It’s precisely because it lacks true consciousness... that it could become terrifying."

His eyes darkened. Shaking off the thought, he reached up and swiftly peeled off the ultra-thin nanofiber mask.

Enough of this. If Mako shot me while I was in disguise, that’d be a lousy end. The mask may fool quantum scanners and infrared, but it’s still suffocating.

"I’ll take out the contacts inside. Let’s go, Ollie. First, we sever Q1’s escape routes."

He tossed the mask into his pack.

"Wait, I almost forgot the most important part..."

He rummaged through the bottom of the bag and pulled out a fleece Santa hat with a white pompom.

"Thirteen years, and Santa finally makes his debut. Hey, Ollie—have my odds of getting shot by Mako dropped with this?"

"Assuming she is armed, initial probability is 50%. Based on registered firearms in Matsumoto City... Calculation complete: Probability of Sidney being shot is 0.00069%."

"I didn’t ask for a precise number, damn it."

Sidney tugged the pompom, adjusting the hat’s shape.

“Who is it?”

The doorbell rang, and Mako looked up from her display.
Her mother, Emiko, worked part-time at the Shinshu University-affiliated lab during the day, and since Mako entered middle school, she’d also started tutoring in the evenings. Tonight was one of those nights—peak exam season—and she hadn’t returned home yet.

“What should I do, Papa?” Mako addressed the display.
“Be careful. If it’s someone suspicious, don’t answer,” came the voice from the screen.
“Okay, wait here.”

She glanced at the video intercom screen—just a man’s chest, clad in a black jacket and sweater.

—Who the heck is this? Total creeper vibes. All black? Super sketch. Should I call the cops?

Then, the intercom called her name.

“Good evening, Mako. Your Santa’s here. This year’s present… is me.”

“…Sid? No way! Are you serious!?”

It was the voice of her mentor—her idol—living all the way in America. Mako bolted for the front door.

As she stepped down into the entryway and cautiously opened it, she found Sidney standing there, topped with a red Santa hat. She stared up at him, wide-eyed.

—Is this for real? He’s… huge in person. Why the Santa hat? Whoa… his face—it’s way more intense than on screen. Wait...

“Sid... your eyes...?” His usual gray-blue eyes had turned deep brown, almost Japanese.

Sidney looked down at her. She barely reached his waist. Dressed in a white turtleneck under a gray hoodie, and black corduroy pants, with tousled short hair, she looked more like a boy than a girl.

—So this is my tiny hacker, Makoto. She’s got a sharp tongue, but... pretty damn adorable up close.

He smiled with his eyes and pointed to his contacts.

“These are just fashion. Everyone wears them these days. But sure, I’ll take them off. Hey Mako—technically, this is our first time meeting, huh?”

Mako blushed and stammered. “Uh... um…”

“Mako, to be honest, I didn’t think my chartered jet could even land in your little village.”

Sidney raised his pitch and grinned. Mako froze for a second, then turned bright red and shot back in English.

“What!? This is not a village! It’s a C-I-T-Y, CITY!!”

“My bad. I just assumed there’d at least be a Starbucks drive-thru,” he shrugged.

“That’s rude! We do have one! And we’ve had it for a while!” she snapped, grabbing the door to slam it shut.

Sidney caught it with his shoulder and laughed, “Whoa, whoa, Mako, c’mon! I flew here at Mach speed, I swear! And hey—your city is awesome! You’ve got a glowing rainbow castle! Fantastic, really.”

Making a silly voice and face, he rambled quickly. Mako, still blushing, pouted and grumbled:

“That was projection mapping! And take off your shoes!”

“Whew, saved,” Sidney chuckled, taking off his big boots and neatly lining them up in the genkan.

“Hey Sid... is LA always this close? We talked this morning, remember?”

As she led him down the narrow hallway, Mako spoke over her shoulder.

“You never call, like ever. I was shocked. But I did what you said—I shut off the Wi-Fi router. What was that test about?”

“Sorry, Mako. Bit of an emergency. The three of us need to plan. And hey—did you do your homework?”

Hunched slightly, Sidney took just a few steps before pausing at the open door to her room.

“Mako… what is that?”

Mako froze. Uh-oh.
She slipped past him and into her room, quickly positioning herself in front of the display to block his view.

—Oh no. Super not okay. This bot? It’s built from Papa’s data, but technically it violates the ‘no-real-person-image-avatars’ rule. But he’s dead. I mean, he’s not real, but… yeah, super not okay.

Just then, a car engine rumbled outside. Tires crunched on gravel. Emiko had returned.

Mako’s heart skipped a beat.

—Mom gets scary when she’s mad. She doesn’t yell, but... that’s even scarier. Wait—did I forget to greet Sid properly?

Outside, Emiko readjusted a huge bundle of Matsumoto Ippon Negi (local green onions) wrapped in newspaper, a gift from a student’s mother. She slid the key into the front door.

—Unlocked? Mako forgot again.

With a sigh, she opened the door—and froze at the sight of a huge pair of unfamiliar black boots.

Her eyes snapped up—and saw a black-clad man peering into Mako’s room.

—Who is that?! Mako?! Did he do something to her!?

Emiko burst up the step without taking off her shoes, dashed down the hall, and smacked the man with her bundle of green onions.

“Mako!!”

Shoving him aside, she rushed into the room—only to find her daughter standing unharmed. Her heart settled—until she saw, on the large screen behind Mako, the smiling face of a long-lost lover.

Momentarily forgetting the man behind her, Emiko turned pale.

“Mako… what is that?”

Surrounded by serious, staring adults, Mako wasn’t sure what face to make.

“I’m sorry—I used Papa’s data… I built a bot. I asked AI how. Sid helped compile it, quantum-built. I used Papa’s old laptop data, his research papers, online stuff... then I made his image... into video... and the voice…”

Her voice trailed off into a whisper.

—Should I just stop talking now?
Her chest pounded. She decided it was best to leave it there.

In the silence of the tiny six-tatami room, the bot spoke:

“Hey, hey! C’mon, Sid, what’s with the face? It’s our big reunion, man.”

Sidney froze mid-step, his glare softening to a narrow squint.

“And Emi. You look well. That’s good to see.”

Emiko flinched.
Sidney pointed at the screen. “Mako, shut it down—no, wait. Don’t touch anything.”

He marched to her PC and yanked the LAN cable.

“Whoa, Sid. Am I banned from the net now?” the bot smiled.

Sid pointed again, voice sharp.

“Shut. Up. One more word and I will shut you down for good.”

Emiko stared in shock. “Wait—uh—”

Sidney sighed, then grinned.

“Hey, Emi. Was hoping for a classier reunion, but hey—your onion punch was legendary.”

He winked. Emiko switched to English, flustered.

“Sidney!? Why are you here? I thought you were an... intruder—I’m so sorry!”

Great. I’m in for a lecture… no, make that two lectures. Mako braced herself, trembling.

But—
Sidney’s Santa hat was now speckled with green onion mud. A broken stalk clung to his pricey-looking black jacket, filling the room with its pungent smell. Her mom? More rattled than Mako had ever seen.

Mako looked down, trying desperately not to laugh.
Sidney plucked the onion off his shoulder, tapped his red-and-green hat, and said,

“A perfect combo—red and green. I’m a Christmas tree.”

Mako couldn’t hold it anymore. She burst out laughing, loud and uncontrollable.
