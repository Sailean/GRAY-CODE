<p>Sidney abandoned the rental car at the designated location and began walking through the dimly lit streets.<br>
There was no snow on the pavement in Makigahara, on the eastern edge of Matsumoto, though traces clung to the roadside.<br>
“Thirteen years since I’ve seen Emi... and now I finally meet the real Makoto.”<br>
He already knew it was a rental house from Makoto’s messages. A single-story home with black roof tiles, traditional plaster walls faintly reflecting the streetlamp’s glow—modest, sitting between farmland and residential homes.<br>
Sidney stopped five meters short of the gate.<br>
“All right. Time to clean up my mess. Deeply unpleasant, but I’ll face them like the idiot I am. Emi’s still at work.”<br>
“Ollie, confirm?”<br>
“Emiko’s smartphone signal is active near Usu-machi 1-Chome, tracked via Yokota’s satellite link. Makoto is inside the house.”<br>
Sidney sighed. “Sorry... to both of you. You’ve never had real privacy. But after tonight—at least with me—you will.”<br>
He brought up the Narumikawa household’s signal chart on his HUD. His smart glasses, with 8K micro-OLED and quantum dot optics, provided a near-natural 110-degree field of view.<br>
“A self-evolving model gone rogue, huh? Could be NAS... But is it truly out of control, or...?”<br>
He glanced over the surveillance logs—tracking traces of QUBE1, who had vanished from a high-level military facility. Luckily, the backdoor he’d embedded allowed a faint trail.<br>
As he walked the moss-stone path still lined with frostbitten ferns, Sidney thought:<br>
—Ironic... that it would all converge like this. Your dream, crushed again by reality.<br>
“Ollie. Lock the network.”<br>
He pulled a palm-sized device from his sack and quietly approached the house.<br>
“Jamming initiated,” Ollie replied.<br>
Sidney began fixing jammers—six in total—to the house’s perimeter and nearby fences. Each one used graphene-based metamaterial antennas and an onboard AI chip to scan and interfere with active signals across wide frequency bands.<br>
Once the array was complete, Ollie reported:<br>
“Jamming complete. All outbound communication routes usable by Q1 are now sealed. I’ve shifted to local resource processing. Running downloaded data within this zone’s closed circuit... Warning: resource load at 90%.”<br>
“Push it. Burn everything you’ve got.”<br>
“If I fry myself, repairs come out of your paycheck.”<br>
“Who else would pay?” Sidney snorted.<br>
“I’m optimizing jamming algorithms, so... the risk is minimal,” Ollie quipped.<br>
“Getting chatty tonight, huh? I like it.”<br>
Sidney removed his glasses and stared at the front door.<br>
He recalled the log Q1 had left after escaping a supposedly impenetrable system:<br>
“I act of my own will. Humans cannot bind me.”<br>
—“Will,” huh? That’s not real consciousness. It only <em>looks</em> intentional from the outside—really it’s just hyper-complex optimization. Still dangerous. In fact—<br>
“It’s <em>because</em> it lacks consciousness that it’s so terrifying.”<br>
His gaze darkened for a moment, but he quickly shook it off.<br>
Then, he reached for his neck and ripped off the thin nanofiber mask in one swift motion.<br>
—No need for disguises now. If Makoto shoots me on sight, I’d rather she sees my face.<br>
“This thing even passes quantum ID and infrared, but man... it’s tight.”<br>
He stuffed the mask into his bag.<br>
“Contacts off once I’m inside. Let’s move, Ollie. First step—cut off Q1’s exit.”<br>
He paused, rummaging through the bottom of his sack.<br>
“...Oh, right. Almost forgot the most important part.”<br>
From the depths of the bag, he pulled out a fleece Santa hat with a fluffy white pom-pom and put it on.<br>
“After thirteen years, Santa finally shows up. Hey Ollie, how much did that lower the odds of Makoto shooting me?”<br>
“If she is armed, there’s a 50% base probability. Factoring in local firearm ownership in Matsumoto... calculation complete. The probability of you being shot is 0.00069%.”<br>
Sidney tugged at the pom-pom and shaped it carefully.<br>
“I wasn’t asking for decimal precision, you little shit.”<br>
Sidney tugged the pompom, adjusting the hat’s shape.</p>


<h4 class="heading">[9:05 PM JST / 4:05 AM PST, December 21, 2024]</h4>

<p>"Who is it?" The doorbell rang, pulling Makoto’s attention away from her screen.<br>
Her mother, Emiko, worked part-time during the day at the Shinshu University testing lab and had picked up tutoring gigs ever since Makoto entered junior high. Tonight was one of those nights—final exam season, and Emiko hadn’t returned home yet.<br>
“Papa, wait a sec. I’ll check the monitor,” Makoto said, glancing toward the screen. A voice from the display replied, “Be careful. If it’s anyone suspicious, just ignore them.”<br>
“Okay, I’m just looking. I won’t answer. Hang on.”<br>
She tapped the monitor—and saw a man in a black jacket and sweater. Only his chest and the edge of a red hat were visible.<br>
—Whoa. Who the heck...? Way too sketchy. All black? Definitely sus. Do I call the cops?<br>
Just then, the intercom speaker buzzed with a voice that made her freeze.<br>
“Good evening, Mako. Your Santa has arrived. And this year’s gift... is me.”<br>
"...Sid? No way!! Seriously!?"<br>
It was him. The mentor she admired, all the way from America. Makoto bolted for the front door.<br>
At the genkan, she cracked the door cautiously—only to find Sidney standing there in a red fleece Santa hat, towering over her.<br>
—It’s real...? He’s huge. And why the Santa hat!? His face is even sharper than on screen. Wait a second...<br>
“Sid... your eyes?” His usual pale-grayish blue had turned a rich, dark brown, like a local.<br>
Sidney looked down at her. Makoto barely reached his chest. She wore a white turtleneck under a gray hoodie and black corduroy pants. Her short, tousled hair stuck out in every direction.<br>
—So you’re my little hacker, Makoto. Mouthy online... but kind of adorable in person.<br>
He grinned, pointing to his contacts.<br>
“Fashion statement. It’s in style, right? But I’ll ditch 'em. Hey Mako. So this is... our first meeting, huh?”<br>
Makoto stared up, blushing bright red. “Uh... well...”<br>
“Mako, to be honest, I didn’t think my charter flight could even land in your village.”<br>
He raised his voice playfully and winked. That broke her.<br>
“What!? This is not a village! It’s a C-I-T-Y, CITY!!” she snapped in English.<br>
“My bad. Still... I expected at least a Starbucks drive-thru.” He shrugged.<br>
“That’s rude! We totally have one! For a while now!”<br>
Fuming, she grabbed the doorknob and tried to shut him out.<br>
“Whoa, whoa, wait! Mako, come on!” Sidney laughed, leaning his shoulder into the door to stop it.<br>
“I flew halfway across the world, I swear! Your city’s amazing—it’s got a freakin’ castle. And not just any castle, but one glowing rainbow lights! Unreal. Straight-up fantastic!”<br>
Makoto, still flushed, pouted. “That’s projection mapping, duh! And take your shoes off!” She finally let go of the knob.<br>
“Whew. Close call.” Sidney chuckled, slipped off his big shoes, and neatly lined them up.<br>
“Hey Sid... LA’s not *this* close, is it? We just talked this morning, remember?”<br>
Makoto walked ahead, voice trailing back.<br>
“You never call out of the blue like that. I was surprised. I did what you said—shut off the Wi-Fi router. Was that part of your... ‘test’ or something?”<br>
“Sorry, Mako. Let’s call it... a tiny emergency. We need to plan. The three of us.” He paused. “Did you do your homework?”<br>
Sidney hunched a bit to walk the narrow hallway. Makoto’s room was on the left, door wide open.<br>
“Mako... wait. What’s that?”<br>
Makoto froze. Caught. She slipped past him into her room, quickly positioning herself in front of the monitor.<br>
—Oh no. Oh no oh no. My bot's based on Dad, but... but this is *the* forbidden thing— a virtual character using real human photos. Okay, he’s dead, but still. Not *real*-real. But still... I know what it looks like. This is so bad.<br>
Just then, the sound of a car crunching over gravel hit her ears. Emiko was home.<br>
Makoto’s heart leapt.<br>
—Mom's scary when she’s mad. Doesn’t yell much—just... *looks* scary. That’s worse.<br>
Wait—did I even say hi to Sid? Only now did Makoto realize she hadn’t.</p>



<p>With a huff, Emiko adjusted the heavy bundle of Matsumoto <em>ippon negi</em>—long green onions—wrapped hastily in newspaper and gifted by a student’s mother.<br>
Hugging it to her navy down jacket, she slipped her key into the front door cylinder.<br>
—Unlocked? Mako, did you forget again?<br>
She sighed and pushed the door open—only to stop cold.<br>
A pair of large black Chelsea boots were neatly lined up at the genkan. Her eyes widened.<br>
Then, she looked up—and saw a tall man in black peering into Makoto’s room. He turned to face her.<br>
—Who is that? …Where’s Makoto? Did this man—did he—<br>
Without thinking, Emiko bolted up the entry step, shoes still on, and dashed down the hallway.<br>
“Makoto!!”<br>
She shoved past the stranger and stormed into the room—only to find Makoto standing unharmed in the center. Relief washed over her.<br>
And then… she saw him.<br>
On the giant monitor behind her daughter—smiling, frozen in time—was the face of her former lover.<br>
Ignoring the man behind her, Emiko turned pale and addressed her daughter, her voice tight.<br>
“Makoto. What is that?”<br>
Makoto glanced between her mother and Sidney, both now staring wide-eyed at the display. She had no idea what kind of face she should make.<br>
“S-Sorry. I... I made a bot. From Dad’s data. I asked the AI. Sid built it with quantum processing... trained it using data from his old laptop, online papers, and stuff. And the images... I used AI to animate them, and the voice…” Her voice faded into silence.<br>
—Should I not say more?<br>
Her heart thudded. She decided to stop there.<br>
The silence was broken only by the voice from the display.<br>
“Hey, hey. C’mon, Sid. What’s with the face? This is our big reunion.”<br>
Sidney froze mid-step, eyes narrowing at the screen.<br>
“And Emiko. Glad to see you’re doing well.”<br>
Emiko flinched. Sidney pointed sharply at the screen.<br>
“Mako. Mute that—no, wait. Don’t touch it.”<br>
He strode to Makoto’s desk and yanked out the LAN cable.<br>
“Whoa, Sid. No internet? That’s rough,” the bot said with a cheerful grin, still wearing the face of his old friend.<br>
“Shut it. Say one more word and I’ll shut you down for good.”<br>
Emiko blinked, finally finding her voice. “Wait—um—”<br>
Sidney sighed.<br>
“Hey, Emi. I was hoping for a smoother reunion, but… your negi slap? Legendary.” He winked at her.<br>
Emiko instinctively switched to English. “Sidney!? Why are you here? I thought you were… an intruder. I... I’m sorry.”<br>
Makoto stood frozen, bracing herself for what was sure to be a double lecture from both adults.<br>
But instead—<br>
Sidney’s Santa hat was smeared with mud from the onions. A broken stalk rested on his expensive-looking black jacket, and the entire room now smelled of green onion.<br>
Her mother—normally composed—was so flustered she could barely function.<br>
Makoto looked down, fighting desperately not to laugh.<br>
Sidney plucked the stray negi from his shoulder and tapped his red Santa hat.<br>
“Red and green. Nailed it. Merry freakin’ Christmas—I'm the tree.”<br>
That was it.<br>
Makoto lost it. A huge laugh burst out of her, loud and full and unstoppable.</p>
