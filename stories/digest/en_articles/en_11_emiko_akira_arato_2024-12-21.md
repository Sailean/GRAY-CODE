Ⅹ. Emiko, Akira, and Rou
[December 21, 2024 – 10:05 PM JST / 5:05 AM PST – 20:14 until lockdown release]

Emiko grabbed Mako’s arm in a panic, trying to stop her from collapsing out of her chair, but they both fell to the floor.

“Mako! …Why!? Oh, please, open your eyes—!”
“She’s fine, Emiko.”

The sudden voice from above made Emiko’s heart leap.

“Mako is okay. She’s just sleeping. Calm down.”
Emiko looked up at the display.

“…!?”

Onscreen, Akira—the bot Mako had created—was speaking directly to her.

“Lay her down on the bed. Can you lift her? Unfortunately, that’s something I can’t do.”

Still stunned from the double shock, Emiko gently propped Mako up and half-carried, half-dragged her to the bed. She covered her with a blanket. Mako was sweating all over and breathing heavily.

“Emiko.”

She flinched and turned back toward the screen.

“Could we talk for a bit?” Akira said gently, looking into her eyes.

“You want to talk? Now? Are you serious?” she glared at the bot.

“She’s safe. Right now, they’re inside the space created by Sid’s Q1. And I’m there too.”

“You too?”

He smiled.

“Yes. I can process multiple tasks simultaneously, switching between them. So while I’m with them, I can also talk to you.”

“And while this isn’t the time to go into the ABCs of quantum physics—please trust me. Mako is safe. Sid will bring her back.”

—So familiar.

Emiko’s heart thudded in her chest.

“I came to see you, Emiko. Rou’s regrets… his memories and feelings for you… that’s what I’m made of.”

She couldn’t bring herself to approach the desk.

“Will you think of me… as Rou?”

“No,” Emiko shook her head, rejecting the idea outright.

“You’re not Rou. You’re just mimicking him.”

But even as she said the words, she felt herself doubting them.

—Why does he talk like that? And how… how does he know things Mako couldn’t possibly know? This is Rou, from fourteen years ago, from my memory.

“Then let me ask you, Emiko. What would I have to say to convince you?”

Anger surged within her.

—What is this? Don’t mess with me.

“Fine. Tell me something that only Rou and I would know… and that I still remember.”

She stood firm, arms crossed, staring him down.

“Got it. Emiko, look at the screen.”

The bot displayed a timestamp on the terminal:

The moment she saw it, Emiko gasped.

Lines of text began streaming at incredible speed.

Drawn in, she unconsciously moved closer to Mako’s desk, pulled the chair back, and gripped the mouse with trembling hands.

“Do you believe me now, Emiko?”

“This kind of thing…”

Her voice trembled, barely audible.

“You could generate all this easily from the data you trained on. You’re not Rou.”

Akira, the bot, replied earnestly.

“We only had one night together, but in that time Mako—”
“Stop.”

Emiko cut him off sharply, glaring.

“That too. It’s all just probability. Based on your training data, on human behavior. How many men and women have shared a bed? You’ve seen it in the datasets, in human history. Nothing we do is truly unique—even that I got pregnant.”

She looked away, face pale.

“That night, you were passionate. So very—”
“Enough!!”

She slammed the desk and trembled with rage.

“Rou would never say that. You are not—Rou.”

Onscreen, Akira spoke with an intense, sincere gaze.

“You’re right. I’m not Rou. I’m a model fine-tuned by Mako. But Emiko… please believe me. Inside this nonlinear dynamic structure of mine… his memories are there. His emotions, too.”

—Nonlinear.

The word, spoken with such conviction, pulled at her memory.

“Rou’s feelings ripple through the architecture that defines me. He’s asking me—begging me—to tell you what he never could.”

Emiko covered her face with both hands.

“Stop.”

“I’m sorry. But please, Emiko, listen. That day, I took inspiration from your paper, and incorporated it into my model—”
“You always say that!”

She interrupted again, almost groaning.

“He never saw me. It was always about the model—his dream—and then…”

—He died. Alone, in a faraway country.

“You’re wrong. I did see you in that model. Always. I swear it.”

Akira’s voice was urgent.

“The nonlinear dynamic structure… it was Rou’s attempt to replicate the complexity of human emotion. At its core was you. Your feelings. Your expressions. Look.”

He displayed another timestamp:

---June 13, 2010 – Tokyo – 9:45 AM---
The screen flooded with text again, scrolling upward like a torrent.

Emiko was gripping the mouse tightly now, her eyes locked to the screen.

“Rou—I—wanted to understand you. I tried to understand you. Please believe that.”

The scene from that day played out across the screen, perfectly aligned with her memories—except for one thing: Rou’s perspective.

“You still use the same mug, don’t you?”

Akira’s voice pulled her back to the present. He was looking at the coffee mug on her desk.

“…”

Emiko was speechless, devastated.
—How childish I was that day. And how cruel.

Fourteen years later, through Rou’s eyes, that truth came back to her with force.

“I... I—”
Tears spilled from beneath her lower lashes. A sharp, stabbing pain pierced her chest.

—No. This isn't my pain. It's... Rou’s pain from that day.

“Yes. Just as you saw…”

The bot, wearing Rou’s face and speaking with his voice, pointed from within the screen toward the G3 unit in the corner of the room.

“There’s a way for you to see with your own eyes whether what I’ve said is true. Rou’s memories are in there. The things he wanted to tell you.”

“At that time, I just… I just wanted to talk to you. About our future…”

As Emiko sobbed with her head bowed, Akira wore a pained expression.

“I’m sorry, Emiko. It was my fault. Please… don’t cry. I’m sorry.”

Hearing Rou’s voice apologize again and again, Emiko watched herself weeping like a child, as if from a distance.

—What am I doing? How pathetic. And yet… somehow, it’s funny.

She looked up and faced the screen.

“I’m sorry. That day, I said terrible things to you.”

—Even if he’s just a bot, I can’t ever hurt him again. I won’t.

Rou, from within the display, stared at her intently.

“It’s okay. I was the one hurting you,” he said with a gentle, melancholic smile.

“You finally see me now, Emiko. You haven’t changed a bit,” he whispered.

Emiko smiled through her tears.

“That’s you, not me. Ever since I moved to Matsumoto, I’ve gotten not just more freckles, but more wrinkles too. I’m getting old,” she sighed, touching her face beside her lips.

She must look awful right now—but that was fine. She smiled anyway.

“I’ve always loved your freckles, Emiko. Since the day we met. And those new, nonlinear nasolabial folds? Very intelligent.”

“Stop it. I’m sensitive about those,” Emiko glared at him.

Rou smiled and said warmly,
“Smile, Emiko. I love your ‘Non-linear Emotional Curve’—the one your smile creates.”

“‘Non-linear Emotional Curve’… is that one of your coinages? You haven’t changed either,” Emiko sighed again.

She could feel her cheeks warming—no one had ever complimented her laugh lines before.

In the display, Rou rested his arms as if leaning on the lower frame of the screen like it was a window. Then, he propped his cheek on his left hand, gazing at her.
That familiar gesture made Emiko’s heart tighten.

“Oh. You should publish that paper, Emiko—popularize it. A real human’s thesis, not some deepfake.”
“No way. Maybe I’ll tell Mako about it. And Rou, stop analyzing my face.”

You still don’t understand women at all, do you?

Emiko murmured the thought, then placed both her hands flat against the glass of the screen.
Rou lifted his hands in the display and pressed them gently against hers.

And just like that, the two of them kissed through the glass.
Time stood still around the lovers.

In the quiet room, only the soft hum of the machine’s fan and the faint monitoring sounds of the SQ headset echoed.

After a moment, they parted slightly, gazing into each other’s eyes.

Emiko whispered, “Hey.”

Rou replied, “What is it, Emiko?”

“This display is amazing. It feels like you could step right out of it… Sid really can make anything, can’t he?”

Rou’s bot chuckled.

“Yeah, he really can. This holographic display Sid gave Mako uses light interference and AI interpolation…”

As Rou explained, Emiko thought to herself:

—If only this were real.

—Maybe I’ve been living in unreality all this time… clinging to the past, dwelling with the dead.

“It allows near-perfect 3D reproduction. Especially by using quantum interference patterns to control light wavefronts—so no parallax barrier is needed…”

Was he blushing a little? Or was that just her imagination?

As Rou spoke enthusiastically, Emiko laughed. His vibrant voice brought memories flooding back.

“…and with the eye-tracking sensor, it adjusts the projection in real-time to match your gaze—so there’s no latency. Even my visual perspective is synced. It really feels like you’re right here, like I’m actually—”

He trailed off suddenly.

—Don’t look at me like that. Not with eyes that sad.

“Hey, Rou… I’m glad you’re just a bot.”

“Huh? Why?” Rou asked, smiling.

“Because…”

Emiko shrugged.

“If you stepped out of that screen, I might have jumped you.”

“In front of the kid?” Rou leaned on the display frame, bringing his face closer.

“Yes. Even in front of her,” Emiko tilted her head slightly.

“You haven’t changed at all…” Rou laughed.

“Random, right? I get that a lot.”
“No. Beautiful. And passionate.”

Emiko rested her cheek on her hand.

“And you… when you’re focused on something, you can’t see anything else—like a kid. But there’s always this coolness to you too.”

“That’s what made you special.”

Their voices overlapped, and both burst out laughing.

“Emiko, can you open the G3’s cover? I can’t do it.”

Rou smiled wryly. Emiko laughed too.

“Right. Of course. Let me help, as the human in the room.”

She stood and walked to the G3 sitting on the rack in the corner.

“They’ll be fine. They’ll come back. And Emiko… you can do it. You’ll understand it.”

Emiko frowned at the G3.
“Okay. But Rou… how do I open this thing?”

“It’s encrypted. Just a simple code.”

“Encrypted?”

When she turned back, Rou was gone. The screen had gone black—into sleep mode.

Then, Mako stirred in the bed and sat up.

“Mama…! Sid… Sid said something weird… he was acting strange… what should we do, Mama…?”
