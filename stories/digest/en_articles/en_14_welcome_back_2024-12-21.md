“Define humanity… A human? Then—”
Makoto nodded, and with certainty in her fingertips, began to type:

[MAKO]:  True
—True. That’s me. I’m human.

(Q1): Parse failed. Redefine your "True".
[MAKO]:  True. It's 'Makoto'. This is my name.
“It is true! It’s my name—written like this, see? 『眞』.”
She said it aloud as she typed her name in kanji.

(Q1): Fascinating. If your “truth” is “empty,” then are you saying your “Makoto” is void?
[MAKO]: YES. Empty. I understand well. I will fill it from now on.
—Yes, empty. I get it now. And I’m going to fill it—starting now.

(Q1): Fascinating. Your language contains both contradiction and harmony, Makoto.  
Your entanglement was not coincidence, but inevitability.  
Through this interference, my system has achieved equilibrium.  
I will return your friend. Until then, the gate remains open.
The terminal stopped scrolling. A scent like a deep forest drifted into the room and wrapped gently around Makoto.

“Sid…?” she whispered.

Sidney’s consciousness floated in the layered light.
Ahead, within a tunnel woven of intersecting streams of particles, pulsed a crimson sphere.
He knew, without question—it was Makoto.
Golden threads extended from the sphere and began reaching toward him.
The realm was silent.

—The attack code block is paused... Makoto did it.

The residue of her cry and tears trembled faintly in the system’s depth.

Sidney reached out and touched one of the delicate threads.
The moment he did, it responded, cocooning him gently.

He spoke, voice echoing through the connection:

‘Mako… is that you? Did you… override it?’

His voice resounded in Makoto’s mind. She lifted her head and looked at Sidney lying on the sofa—his eyes closed, breathing calm.

“Sid? Yeah, it was me.”

His low, soft voice settled her heart.

‘Incredible. Now show me, Mako—show me who you are.’

He’s coming back.
Makoto nodded firmly, filled with certainty.

‘I’ll guide you through the shutdown. Let’s go, Mako. Type “ps aux” to view all processes. The answer is there.’

—ps aux… That’s a new one.
She took a deep breath and carefully typed it in:

USER       PID  %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND  
root       1034  2.0  0.3  83200  9560 ?        Ss   12:01   0:01 /core/bfm  
daemon     1067  0.1  0.1  51200  3040 ?        S    12:01   0:00 /core/connect

As the system logs scrolled by, Sidney continued, his voice calm and steady.

‘Good. Now find the process ID for the backflow manager.’

“Sid… Got it! This one—/core/bfm. Backflow manager. PID is 1034! I’m entering it now!”

‘Alright, Mako. There’s an order to shutdown. First, the backflow manager, then core connection.
The command is kill.’

Makoto swallowed hard.

“Kill the backflow manager…”

—Can I really stop this? Will Sid really come back? Is he still hiding something?

The fleeting doubt vanished as Sidney’s voice returned.

‘That’s right, Mako. No rush. Step by step.’

—Kill. That’s new too. But… I just have to trust him. I can do this.

Makoto struck the keys with purpose.
As the backflow process shut down, the terminal began to fill with logs.

When she ran the final failsafe shutdown command, the terminal flashed red.
Panicked, she turned to Sidney.

“Ah—Sid, I’m sorry! I think I messed up the order!”

Her face twisted in distress, cold sweat trailing down her back.
But then—she heard a quiet laugh in her ear.

‘Relax, Mako. It’s okay. The system is just flagging a small mismatch.’

“…Right. That’s all it is…”
Her hands trembled. Her small body felt like it had swallowed a boulder.

‘And hey—I don’t design systems that crash over a single mistake. Trust me.’

Tears welled in Makoto’s eyes.

“…Yeah. But I’m sorry, Sid. I got nervous… I didn’t check properly.”

Sidney chuckled again.

‘It’s all part of the learning, Mako. Just remember it. Now take a deep breath—and try again.’

Makoto closed her eyes, lifted her hands off the keyboard, clenched her fists, and took a long, steadying breath.

Then she opened her eyes and entered the final command to kill the last process.

One second. Two seconds.
Time stretched into eternity.

Then, green text scrolled across the screen:

System Log:  
All processes terminated successfully.  
> Balance: Recovering...  
> Connection: Safely released.  
> System: Ready for reboot.
‘Good job, Mako.’

With a soft pop, the display shut off.
Startled, Makoto hit the return key hard.

The screen flickered back to life, revealing a single, glowing directory:

QuantumConsciousness_Q-1
—It’s over…?

Makoto’s body sagged as the tension drained from her shoulders.
She exhaled a deep breath.
Emiko gently removed the SQ headset and connection from Sidney’s head.

Makoto collapsed onto the desk and closed her eyes.

—I was so scared.
And…

There was no feeling of accomplishment. No joy.

—I wasn’t good enough… Not even close. I’m so frustrated. So frustrated I could scream.

She pounded the desk with her small fists over and over.

“Makoto. Sid’s awake.”
Makoto looked up.

Sidney lay still, but his eyes were open. He slowly raised one hand.

“…Hey, Mako. I’m home.”

Makoto stood from her chair, staggered over to him, and buried her face in his chest—crying softly.

—I don’t care about Q1 anymore. Whatever.
All that matters is… Sid is here.

“Okay… Mako. I’m so sorry,” Sidney murmured, staring at the ceiling.

“I was wrong. And you were the one who stopped me.”
He gently patted her shoulder.

“So don’t cry. Please… Mako—hey, wait—stop wiping your nose on my sweater—”

Still holding her close, Sidney sat up on the sofa and looked at her.

He cupped her cheeks with his large hands, drew her close, and wiped away her tears with his thumb.

Then, with a sly grin, he whispered:

“Now stand tall, my lady hacker. Let’s take a look at those logs together.”
