III. Billy’s Bar
October 15, 2010 — San Jose, California

At Billy’s Bar on South First Street, regulars who’d clocked out for the day gathered cheerfully around the pool table.

On the back wall of the bar, behind the counter, shelves of dark wood were lined with bottles of Strike Brewing. Nearby, a few posters of California landscapes clung to the walls—sun-bleached and proud.

Sidney sat quietly in the dim lighting, swirling the ice in his glass as he glanced around the bar.
The heavy oak door opened with a soft chime. He turned to look.

Akira stepped inside—moss-green shirt under a beige cardigan. Spotting Sidney, he raised a hand in greeting.

He’s lost weight, Sidney thought.

Akira’s eyes had dark circles beneath them. Despite the fatigue carved into his face, he smiled innocently.

“Sorry I’m late. I called you out and then made you wait. You look good though, Sid.”

Sidney smirked. “You look like hell. Been squeezed hard, huh?”
He lifted his glass.

Akira laughed. “Hell, really? I’m doing fine. Enjoying myself, actually.”
He patted Sidney on the shoulder and pulled out the oak chair beside him.

“Well, good. I had something to talk to you about too,” Sidney said, locking eyes with him.
Akira relaxed into the seat, relieved. “Then perfect timing. How long are you staying?”

“Heading back tomorrow. No rest for the wicked.”

Akira laughed. “Coming from you, that’s the best joke I’ve heard all week.”
He turned to the bartender. “Bourbon on the rocks, please.” He smiled back at Sidney.

“Oh, right—Sid. That emergency alert system you set up? It came in handy. There was a minor electrical short the other day, but it caught it.”

He rested his chin on his hand, gazing at the scarred table.

“I know. The center wasn’t the only one notified. I got the alert too.”

Akira blinked. “You did? I didn’t know that. Thanks.”

Sidney’s smile was thin. “A short circuit, huh. Let’s hope it really was an accident.”

Akira thought he saw a shadow cross Sidney’s face, but it vanished with the next sip of bourbon.

“Anyway. Free service for a year. Use it well.”

Then, eyes sharpening, he asked, “Something happen in the lab?”

“No... not the lab,” Akira said carefully. “But you said you had something to tell me. Let’s hear your story first.”

“Akira. How’s Jessica?”

The question was sudden. Sidney smiled, but his tone carried weight.

Akira frowned in confusion. “Jessica...? Oh, right. She’s... doing okay, I think. Single mom, it’s tough. But she’s managing. Why do you ask?”

“Your lab’s security’s a little too lax, it seems,” Sidney said in a low voice.

“Wait—what?” Akira’s eyes flickered away for a moment, then returned to meet Sidney’s.
“Come on. I can’t believe that. She’s diligent. She fits in with the team.”

Sidney set down his glass. “That optimism of yours. Same as ever. Be careful.”

He looked him dead in the eye.

“You know what this country is.”

Akira raised a hand, cutting him off. “Come on. That’s ancient history. Sid—why are you even—wait... no way. Did you...?”

He leaned in, voice barely a whisper.

“You hacked something? How do you know all this? What do you know, Sid?”

Sidney didn’t flinch. He swirled the last of his ice, meeting Akira’s eyes evenly.

“I know more than you, at the very least.”

Akira exhaled through his nose. “Of course you do. I should’ve known. I can’t even pretend to be surprised anymore.”

He dropped his gaze to his clasped hands on the table.

“Just feels like... here we go again.”

Sidney leaned forward. “Don’t leave bait out for the media. If they catch the scent, it’s already too late.”

Akira shrugged, taking a slow breath. “I don’t manage the lab’s security. You, of all people, should know how they refused to let us go cloud-based. Besides—”

His drink arrived. He paused to thank the bartender with a smile, then cupped the glass and continued, stirring gently.

“My research isn’t mine alone. It only exists thanks to everyone in the lab.
There’s nothing I need to hide from them, and honestly, there’s not much value in what’s out there yet. Emotion matrix calculations, SVM approaches—they’re mainstream now.”

Sidney raised an eyebrow. “Value’s determined by demand, not novelty.”
He took a sip.

Akira smiled faintly. “Sid... you know what these US–Japan joint projects really are. Just political showcases.
America wants to monopolize the tech, and Japan wants to show off the results.
And we researchers? We’re the ones getting squeezed.”

Sidney gave a small, dry smile. Akira nodded, then added:

“You saw it, right? The lab’s a dump. We’re chronically under-resourced.
The old machines barely run. The Xeon E5520 is a dinosaur.
Biosignal measurements are noisy—EEG sensors can’t even give clean data. Just running facial recognition models takes forever.”

He stared down into his bourbon, face darkening.

“We’ve only got two GPUs. The Quadro FX 5800 runs, but training large neural networks? It’s a slog.
And on this budget... there’s no fixing it.”

Looking up at Sidney, he gave a weary smile. Sidney just raised his glass, a wry grin on his lips.

“Your boss should’ve approved my security proposal. ‘Conflict of interest,’ huh? What a joke.
If clinging to appearances could protect data, no one would be working overtime.”

Akira laughed like a kid. “I get it, Sid. I really do. But... I’m Japanese.”

Sidney narrowed his eyes. “What’s that supposed to mean?”

Akira met his gaze again, his usual soft smile returning.

“If I’m going to make it here, I have to start by trusting the people around me.
Otherwise, they won’t trust me either.”

“That’s too naive. You’ll get used. People like you—too quick to trust—drag others down with them.”

Akira remembered the day they met, six years ago, and smiled faintly.

“Maybe. Yeah, maybe you’re right.
If you hadn’t been there that day... who knows where I’d be now.
But still, Sid—people like me need to exist.
That’s the butterfly effect.
Someone’s gotta believe first, or nothing starts at all.”

Sidney studied his face in silence for a beat.

“If you can’t see the storm coming, it’ll blow you away.
But if you want to start the storm...
you’d better know how many butterflies it’ll take.”

Akira looked at him, then nodded slowly.

Sidney continued.

“Be careful who’s behind you.
The people you’re trying to trust—they’re not looking to collaborate. They want to use you. Own your data.”

Akira gave a tired laugh.

“You’re harsh, Sid.
But it’s fine. I came here ready to give that data.
I’m learning from their tech—that’s fair.
And what I gain here... it’ll be a weapon I can use in the future.”

He raised his glass again.

“When you go back to Japan, no one here will remember your name,” Sidney said, voice low.

Akira shook his head.

“That’s not it. I’m here to see. To stand at the frontier.
Japan has limits—resource limits. Especially human resources.
America is rich in both. It’s frustrating.
But that’s why Japan has to learn from this place.
And I want to build this kind of environment back home.”

“You’re something else. Idealists like you don’t usually last.”

Akira grinned. “Who knows? I might not.
But I’ve got to try. Otherwise, nothing changes.”

He looked down, then added quietly:

“If emotion research ever becomes real—if we could read what’s behind the expressions on people’s faces—
I want to see that. Even if I don’t own it.”

He looked up again.

“And if my theories help someone, somewhere... that’s enough.
What I really want to see... is what comes after.”

Sidney chuckled.

“You’re a true idealist. I’ve seen plenty like you.
Most of them don’t live long.”

Akira shrugged. “Then if I’m about to get shot, Sid, you’d better come save me. If you’re still my friend.”

He winked.

Sidney stared at him for a long moment. His voice dropped low.

“What if I’m your enemy?”

Akira’s gaze was calm and still. “You’re not. You’re on my side.”

Sidney arched an eyebrow, swirling his glass. “Is that so.”

After a pause, his voice went quiet.

“What if I already stole your research and sold it?”

Akira smiled softly, sipping his drink.

“Knew you’d say that.”

Then, meeting Sidney’s eyes:

“You haven’t.
And you won’t.”

Sidney snorted and set down his glass. “There’s no guarantee I won’t betray you.”

Akira lifted his shoulders in a shrug.

“If you were really my enemy, you wouldn’t be telling me this.
And even if someday you do betray me...
that’s on me. For choosing to trust you.”

Sidney sighed.

“Can’t believe you’ve lasted this long in this country. Haven’t you learned?”

“I’m stubborn. Still breathing.
But thanks. I’ll be careful.”

He winked again.

Sidney stared at him.

“Akira, I’ve said this before.
Your research—I believe in it.
Especially your integration of facial emotion recognition and EEG patterns.
It’s brilliant. Too good for that lab.
One last time—I’m asking.
When your JSPS term is over... come work for me.”

Akira smiled. “Sorry, Sid. I want to finish what I started.
Bring those results home.
I’ve got something I want to do in Japan.”

He turned to the bar counter, voice dropping to a murmur.

“Where I’m from... it snows for a third of the year.”

“Yeah. You’re from the far north of Nagano, right?” Sidney replied.

Akira nodded. “In winter, we nail wooden boards over the windows.
To keep them from breaking under the snow.
It gets so dark inside, even during the day—you need lights.”

His gaze settled on a faded poster on the wall.

“But even in a place like that...
Spring always comes, Sid.
A beautiful spring.”

Leaning on his left elbow, he stared at the poster: Yosemite, thawing snow cascading down the rocks, delicate blue flowers blooming beside the cold river.

“My theory... it’s still not real.
And even if it becomes real, today’s tech might not be enough.
But someday—”

He smiled faintly.

“Someday, technology will catch up.
To my theory.
And maybe then... a machine that understands emotion—
connects people—will be possible.”

Sidney exhaled a laugh. “Even I can’t argue with that much dreaming.
Here’s to you, Akira.
Stay alive long enough, and I might just buy that research off you.”

“Will you come to Japan? Either way, I’ll be waiting.”

Akira downed his bourbon in one go, raised his empty glass to Sidney, and grinned.

Sidney sighed, signaling the bartender for another.

“So. What was it you wanted to tell me?”

Akira looked down. “Ah... yeah. So, um...”

“What?” Sidney raised an eyebrow. “You’re blushing. Don’t tell me you finally found someone here?”

Akira snapped up. “What—no! I mean, no, it’s not that. It’s the opposite.”

Sidney narrowed his eyes. “So Emiko found someone?”

He sipped his fresh bourbon, letting the flavor roll across his tongue.
He took a slow inhale through his nose, savoring it.

“No... she’s pregnant.
It’s mine.
Ours.”

Sidney set down his glass and stared. “...Well then. So?”

Akira blinked. “So...? What do you mean, so?”

“Good news, right? You proposed, I assume? I told you about that jeweler.”

Akira gave a sheepish smile. “You’re not even surprised. That’s so you, Sid... Thanks again. You really helped me back then.”

Back in spring, Akira had asked Sidney about a jewelry store. Sidney had pointed him toward a craftsman who could do custom work on a budget.

Sidney raised his glass again.

“So... why are you telling me this? You’re not asking me for advice, are you?”

He chuckled dryly. “You picked the worst possible guy.”

Akira stared into his bourbon.
Sidney sighed internally.

“Well... congrats, I guess.”
He paused. “That is—if the kid’s really yours.”

Akira’s eyes widened. “What the hell, Sid? Emiko would never—”

“Calm down. Just a possibility. I’ve never met her, after all.
But people change. Distance and time do that.
You’ve built your dream in America—so what is she now?”

“...She still wants to do research. That’s why she took a postdoc. She knew how hard it would be.”

Sidney snorted. “So?
You think a long-distance relationship across the Pacific is gonna work?”

Akira fell silent again, eyes back on his glass.
Sidney watched him, narrowing his eyes.

Why do I always get dragged into this guy’s mess...

“Talk to me. Just know—I don’t sugarcoat.”

Akira’s expression eased a little.

“Last month, Emiko called me. Said... it’s been four months.”

“If you’ve got the ring, then propose already.”

“I do. Thanks to you, I got it here.
But I haven’t proposed yet. Her birthday’s on Christmas.
I thought I’d do it then, during the holiday break.”

“Why wait?”

Akira had no answer.

Sidney sipped, thinking: The order doesn’t matter. But is it even his?

“You didn’t say anything stupid to her, did you?”

Akira scratched his jaw, looking genuinely worried.

Damn. The guy can’t even take a joke.

Sidney chuckled, watching him fondly.

He remembered a photo from a mailing list—Akira and Emiko side by side. He also recalled her writing:
calm, intelligent, rational... a Japanese woman’s face, gentle but strong.

Sidney sighed.

“Relax. Just messing with you, Akira.”

He waved at the bartender, pointing at Akira’s glass for a refill.

“I just... I don’t know what to say to her,” Akira murmured.

He really shouldn’t have told me all this... oh well. Switching modes.

Sidney sighed again, this time silently.

“What did you say? When she called?”

“I told her to wait. That I’d be back for Christmas break.”

“Did she decide to keep it? Did you two talk about it properly?”

Akira said nothing.

“You don’t want to go back? To Japan?”

Akira looked up, sadness flickering behind his eyes.

“I do. God, I do. Since she told me, I’ve wanted to go back.
But I can’t.”

Sidney understood. The lab was understaffed.
Akira was on a JSPS grant. No room for flexibility.

“She told me... she didn’t know what to do.
I’ve never heard her sound like that before.
So I said—we’d figure it out together.”

Sidney glanced at the bartender returning with drinks.

“You’re cutting it too close. December’s too late.”

Akira nodded. “She said... this month is the limit.”

He stared at the amber liquid in his glass.

“You have to talk to her. Seriously. Lay it all out.”

Akira nodded slowly, still looking down. “Yeah.
Never hated Skype and time zones more in my life.”

“Did she tell anyone else?”

Sidney asked, even though he knew he was getting too involved.

“No. Her parents passed away. She’s not close with her brother’s family.
I think I’m the only one who knows.”

Sidney leaned on the table, pointing at Akira’s chest.

“Then you talk to her. Even an email.
Really listen.”

“We have a private message board. Just for the two of us...
But I don’t know what to write.”

Sidney looked at him and suddenly thought of his brother.
The resemblance was faint—but it was there.

If he were still alive... he’d be around Akira’s age.

He shrugged.

“I’m not your mom. Figure it out yourself.”

“Sorry. You’re right.
It’s just—no matter what I say, I feel like I’ll hurt her.”

Sidney stared.

This guy... seriously?

“You’ve already hurt her. That ship’s sailed.”

“I know... I thought we were careful. I was careful...”

Sidney chuckled.

“No matter how advanced technology gets,
as long as people are involved, there’ll be mistakes. Always.”

He stirred his drink again, voice steady.

“Believing it’s foolproof? That’s the biggest mistake of all.
That’s why I eliminated risk altogether.”

Akira looked up, stunned.

“You mean...?”

“Yeah. I made sure I’d never pass on my DNA.”

He sipped and smiled.

“If you’ve failed to protect someone once,
you don’t get to promise to protect anyone else.
For me, family is a liability.”

Akira always thought Sidney was a striking figure.
He looked younger than his age, tall and lean with sculpted features and a well-trimmed beard. His skin was bronze, his grayish-blue eyes sharp enough to read minds.
Long black hair, tied loosely at the nape. Subtle but expensive clothes.

He must’ve been popular back in the day. Probably still is.

Akira thought of a stunning woman he’d met at a Nexus party—
introduced as “a friend” by Sidney.
She claimed to be an artist, but even Akira recognized her—one of the top American models.
They didn’t hide their relationship, but never confirmed it either.

“Sid...” Akira started, but then stopped. It’s private.

Sidney laughed softly to himself.

What am I even doing, saying this stuff?

He raised his glass again and flashed a grin.

“If you think it’s important, then now’s the time.
Call her. Message her. Talk it through, properly.”

“I will...
Thanks, Sid.”

Akira lifted his glass like a child apologizing to a parent.
Sidney raised his own.

“To you, Akira—the world’s most sincere idiot.”

Their glasses clinked.

“Hey... Sid.” Akira looked at the poster on the wall again.

“If something ever happened to me—
Would you... check in on Emiko? Just a little?”

“I don’t hire plant geneticists, you know.”

Akira laughed. “Not what I meant.
As a friend.
You’re the only one I can say this to.”

“I don’t make promises.
But this is America—anything could happen.
If she needs help, I’ll be there.”

Sidney instantly regretted saying something so ominous.

“You’re bold when it comes to research.
But when it’s women... you’re hopeless.
You need to redo middle school. Emiko’s your first, right?”

Akira frowned. “No.
She’s the second.”

Sidney raised his brows. “Really?
So what happened to the first one? Did you dump her?”

Akira gave him a side glance. “No.
She dumped me.
Said I was like a robot.”

Sidney chuckled.

“Damn. Harsh. Don’t worry, Akira. You just lack experience.”

He reached across the table and patted his friend’s shoulder.

“But Emiko shows you a face she shows no one else.
She wants to lean on you.
You’ve got this, Akira.”

“Shows me a face no one else sees...?”

Sidney nodded.

“She’s giving you a chance to win her heart again.
Step up.”

“Sid... I—”
Akira faltered. Sidney winked and stood.

“That’s enough talk.
Tonight, take an Uber.
This city’s not safe for guys with baby faces like you.”

Akira remembered the hackathon where they first met.
He sighed, slightly exasperated.

“Yeah... I know.
But I’ll never get used to this part of America.”

“Smart boy.
Keep our little secret.
I’ll walk you to the main street—my hotel’s just past it.”

Akira stood as well. “Thanks, Sid.
Really.”

He smiled, looking up at the tall man by his side.
