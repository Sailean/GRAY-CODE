II. Misalignment
June 13, 2010 — Tokyo — Akira and Emiko’s Apartment

<p>When he woke, Emiko was still asleep beside him.
She’s really home now.

Through the window came the layered sounds of the city.

The hiss of a bus door opening. The release of compressed air from the engine’s pneumatic cylinders, followed by the hush of negative pressure—a sound Akira had always loved.
The way its bloated envelope of sound collapsed in an instant, fading into silence.

The high whine of the engine as the bus pulled away from the stop, overlapping with a child calling out, Mommy!

From far away, across the humid air of early June, the rhythmic chirping of the pedestrian signal arrived in fragments—cut off, reemerging—lost amid the flow of traffic and people.

And then... the quiet hum of the air conditioner, gently shaking the walls.

Akira propped his head up with one arm and gently pulled the blanket back over Emiko’s bare shoulder.

Today... I go back. Back to that dry city.

He let out a quiet sigh and swept a few stray strands of hair from her cheek and brow.
His eyes traced her face, scanning for features—mapping expressions.

Angle of the brows... the corner of her eyes... the shape of her mouth—Action Units.

From this combination, her emotional state should be inferable.
But her eyes were closed—data unavailable.

She’s beautiful.

“What are you thinking about... Emi?”

He traced her curved brow with his thumb, then gently over the freckles scattered near her nose.

The curve of your shoulder... the line of your cheek... your lips.
You’re built of nonlinear variables.

Unquantifiable data looped in his mind, and a soft warmth began to stir in his chest.
He reached for the notebook beside the bed, bound in soft deerskin, and wrote a line:

You disrupt my math. Every formula breaks.

A beam of light slipped through the blackout curtains and made Emiko squint.
Akira checked the digital clock by the bed, then rose quietly and pulled the curtain shut again.</p>



<p>***</p>


<p>After breakfast, Akira sat cross-legged on the floor of his tiny study, facing his beloved machine.

A 1997 Apple Power Macintosh G3 Desktop, low and heavy, the kind with a horizontal body.
He had maxed out every slot, upgraded the RAM, and—too lazy to add another internal hard drive—used externals, leaving the drive bay empty.

“...I never said it, after all.”

He murmured the words, sighing deeply.
His eyes drifted to the deerskin notebook lying beside him. Gently, he rested a hand on its cover.

“Alright. Let’s finish this.”

As if shaking something off, he peered into the G3’s chassis.

“You’re beautiful. So simple. Clean now... and—ah!”

With a small cry, he grabbed the notebook, spread it open across his knees, and began to write.

“I’ve got it. I can express it. The structure’s solid... maybe twist the output a bit. Yeah, this is good. It’ll get through—”

Smiling, he jotted down a stream of letters and numbers in the notebook’s margins.

“This part... will be encrypted. Encoded, but simple enough. She’ll be able to read it.”

He stood, booted up the small laptop on his desk, and tapped the trackpad.
As a spreadsheet appeared on-screen, he began typing code standing up, running and refining it a few times.
Satisfied, he copied the final output into his notebook.

He had just sat back down on the floor when there was a knock at the door.

“Can I come in?” Emiko entered with two coffee mugs in her hands.
“You’re working? …No, maybe not.”

The plain white cotton shirt looked good on her—healthy, soft-toned.
The desk was buried under books, laptops, printouts, and scribbled notes.
No space for a mug.

She glanced from the cluttered floor to Akira crouched before the G3 and sighed.

“Did it have to be now? Is your flight time okay?”

Trying to place a mug beside him, she hesitated—“Dangerous.”
Scanning the desk, she searched for a single mug-sized space.

“Yeah, I’ve got time. Just wanted to clean the G3... and clear my head.”

She noticed one of his notes, half-buried under a book, its uneven handwriting familiar.
Sliding the book aside, she placed his mug down and picked up the paper.

Emotional Intelligence in AI – New Approach
She read aloud, scanning the next line.

“‘Numerical representation of emotional states...’”

Her eyes continued down to the equations.

“This is... basic edge detection. We use it too—for analyzing cell images.”

She read on.

“‘Standard Gaussian filter ➡➡ applied to gene regulatory networks?’ …That’s an interesting approach.”

She glanced up at him.

Akira looked up and smiled. “Yeah. Treat the blur of the filter as fluctuation.”

Emiko gave a tight smile in return.

“I was re-reading your paper this morning. And I had a thought—
There’s a correlation between gene expression patterns and emotional states.
What if we could apply gene network algorithms... to an SVM?”

Emiko gently set the note down.

“Sure, gene regulation might appeal to you.
But... are human emotions really something you can compare to a mathematical model?
I don’t think so.”

She held his gaze.

“That’s exactly why,” Akira said, suddenly rising.
He woke the laptop, its screen lighting up.

“Emotion changes dynamically—just like gene expression chains.
If I could apply that to my emotion model... it’d be more dynamic.
Like this: facial test data.”

He picked up her paper and pointed at the display.
Multiple snapshots of Emiko’s face, each with slight variations, appeared on the screen.

“Classify emotions based on these micro-movements... then model their interactions.”

His eyes fixed on the images of Emiko, thought spiraling inward.

“No... SVM isn’t enough. It needs something more complex—”

He began composing formulas in his mind.
Resisting the urge to reach for his notebook beside her, he sat frozen.

“Akira...”
Emiko turned her gaze from the screen to his profile.

“Even plant gene expression changes unpredictably with the environment.
Can human emotion—far more complex—really be expressed in equations?”

“You’re right. That’s why... it needs even more complex equations—”

His voice grew tight, uncertainty seeping in.
The scientist in him rejected half-formed images before they could become words.

“A precise... nonlinear dynamic system... maybe that could—”

His thoughts looped. Words failed.
The frustration of vision without language clouded his face.

Emiko stood stiffly beside the desk, waiting.
The silence between them deepened the distance in the room.

Akira finally spoke.

“If this research succeeds—”

“Again. Research?”

She cut him off sharply, setting the mug down on the edge of the desk with a hard clink.
Akira instinctively looked at the cup.

“Yes. Your life’s theme—research. I get it. I’m a researcher too.”

She turned her back to him, arms spreading like a speaker on a stage.

“Can a machine understand human emotion?
Can it go beyond calculation—to empathy?
Yes—I, Akira Arato, am building the theory, the algorithm to make that possible.”

“Emi, I—”

He searched for words. None came.
She remained turned away, shoulders slumped.

“I’m sorry. I’ve got to head to campus.”

Her voice softened, fading.

“Gotta get ready.”

Hand on the doorknob, she added quietly:

“Next time’s... December, right? I’ll go ahead.
Take care. Don’t forget your phone.”

The door closed with a soft click.
The latch echoed in the stillness.

Left alone, Akira picked up the notebook and stared at the open page.
Then, slowly, he tore out the freshly written sheet and crushed it in both hands.

“What I wanted to say to you was...”

He let out a small breath and tossed the crumpled paper into the waste bin.

Maybe... Emiko understands me better than anyone else.

Sipping cold coffee, he thought back on the past five days in Japan.
He’d been at a full conference in Nagasaki, returning to Tokyo only yesterday.

We barely talked about the future.

He imagined Emiko’s composed face.

I thought I understood her. So I kept pushing, harder, deeper... but...

They had been living together for five years.
His San Jose lab position was for two.
The future was hazy.
Emiko never complained.
But... this couldn’t go on.

Akira set the mug down and glanced at the bin.
Then, retrieving the crumpled page, he smoothed it carefully.
Fingers traced the creases.
He folded it neatly and crouched down.

Opening the G3’s empty bay, he tucked the paper inside.

“A program to understand emotion... huh.”

He laughed quietly, half to himself, and looked at his bag.
Reaching for the zipper, he paused.

“Maybe that’s what I need most—right now.”

Sunlight from the early summer window stung his eyes.
He closed them and whispered, almost in prayer:

“But someday...
I’ll get there. I swear.”

Two coffee cups, long gone cold, sat on opposite ends of the desk—
like punctuation marks to a conversation unfinished.</p>
