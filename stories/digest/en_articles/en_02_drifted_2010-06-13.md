<p>When he woke, Emiko was still asleep beside him.<br>
She’s really home now.<br>
Through the window came the layered sounds of the city.<br>
The hiss of a bus door opening. The release of compressed air from the engine’s pneumatic cylinders, followed by the hush of negative pressure—a sound Akira had always loved.</p>

<p>The way its bloated envelope of sound collapsed in an instant, fading into silence.<br>
The high whine of the engine as the bus pulled away from the stop, overlapping with a child calling out, Mommy!<br>
From far away, across the humid air of early June, the rhythmic chirping of the pedestrian signal arrived in fragments—cut off, reemerging—lost amid the flow of traffic and people.<br>
And then... the quiet hum of the air conditioner, gently shaking the walls.</p>

<p>Akira propped his head up with one arm and gently pulled the blanket back over Emiko’s bare shoulder.<br>
Today... I go back. Back to that dry city.<br>
He let out a quiet sigh and swept a few stray strands of hair from her cheek and brow.<br>
His eyes traced her face, scanning for features—mapping expressions.</p>

<p>Angle of the brows... the corner of her eyes... the shape of her mouth—Action Units.<br>
From this combination, her emotional state should be inferable.<br>
But her eyes were closed—data unavailable.<br>
She’s beautiful.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking about... Emi?”<br>
He traced her curved brow with his thumb, then gently over the freckles scattered near her nose.<br>
The curve of your shoulder... the line of your cheek... your lips.<br>
You’re built of nonlinear variables.</p>

<p>Unquantifiable data looped in his mind, and a soft warmth began to stir in his chest.<br>
He reached for the notebook beside the bed, bound in soft deerskin, and wrote a line:<br>
You disrupt my math. Every formula breaks.<br>
A beam of light slipped through the blackout curtains and made Emiko squint. Akira checked the digital clock by the bed, then rose quietly and pulled the curtain shut again.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>After breakfast, Akira sat cross-legged on the floor of his tiny study, facing his beloved machine.<br>
A 1997 Apple Power Macintosh G3 Desktop, low and heavy, the kind with a horizontal body.<br>
He had maxed out every slot, upgraded the RAM, and—too lazy to add another internal hard drive—used externals, leaving the drive bay empty.<br>
“...I never said it, after all.”</p>

<p>He murmured the words, sighing deeply.<br>
His eyes drifted to the deerskin notebook lying beside him. Gently, he rested a hand on its cover.<br>
“Alright. Let’s finish this.”<br>
As if shaking something off, he peered into the G3’s chassis.</p>

<p>“You’re beautiful. So simple. Clean now... and—ah!”<br>
With a small cry, he grabbed the notebook, spread it open across his knees, and began to write.<br>
“I’ve got it. I can express it. The structure’s solid... maybe twist the output a bit. Yeah, this is good. It’ll get through—”<br>
Smiling, he jotted down a stream of letters and numbers in the notebook’s margins.</p>

<p>“This part... will be encrypted. Encoded, but simple enough. She’ll be able to read it.”<br>
He stood, booted up the small laptop on his desk, and tapped the trackpad.<br>
As a spreadsheet appeared on-screen, he began typing code standing up, running and refining it a few times.<br>
Satisfied, he copied the final output into his notebook.</p>

<p>He had just sat back down on the floor when there was a knock at the door.<br>
“Can I come in?” Emiko entered with two coffee mugs in her hands.<br>
“You’re working? …No, maybe not.”<br>
The plain white cotton shirt looked good on her—healthy, soft-toned.</p>

<p>The desk was buried under books, laptops, printouts, and scribbled notes.<br>
No space for a mug.<br>
She glanced from the cluttered floor to Akira crouched before the G3 and sighed.<br>
“Did it have to be now? Is your flight time okay?”</p>

<p>Trying to place a mug beside him, she hesitated—“Dangerous.”<br>
Scanning the desk, she searched for a single mug-sized space.<br>
“Yeah, I’ve got time. Just wanted to clean the G3... and clear my head.”<br>
She noticed one of his notes, half-buried under a book, its uneven handwriting familiar.</p>

<p>Sliding the book aside, she placed his mug down and picked up the paper.<br>
Emotional Intelligence in AI – New Approach<br>
She read aloud, scanning the next line.<br>
“‘Numerical representation of emotional states...’”</p>

<p>Her eyes continued down to the equations.<br>
“This is... basic edge detection. We use it too—for analyzing cell images.”<br>
She read on.<br>
“‘Standard Gaussian filter ➡➡ applied to gene regulatory networks?’ …That’s an interesting approach.”</p>

<p>She glanced up at him.<br>
Akira looked up and smiled. “Yeah. Treat the blur of the filter as fluctuation.”<br>
Emiko gave a tight smile in return.<br>
“I was re-reading your paper this morning. And I had a thought—”</p>

<p>There’s a correlation between gene expression patterns and emotional states.<br>
What if we could apply gene network algorithms... to an SVM?”<br>
Emiko gently set the note down.<br>
“Sure, gene regulation might appeal to you."</p>

<p>But... are human emotions really something you can compare to a mathematical model?<br>
I don’t think so.”<br>
She held his gaze.<br>
“That’s exactly why,” Akira said, suddenly rising.</p>

<p>He woke the laptop, its screen lighting up.<br>
“Emotion changes dynamically—just like gene expression chains.<br>
If I could apply that to my emotion model... it’d be more dynamic.<br>
Like this: facial test data.”</p>

<p>He picked up her paper and pointed at the display.<br>
Multiple snapshots of Emiko’s face, each with slight variations, appeared on the screen.<br>
“Classify emotions based on these micro-movements... then model their interactions.”<br>
His eyes fixed on the images of Emiko, thought spiraling inward.</p>

<p>“No... SVM isn’t enough. It needs something more complex—”<br>
He began composing formulas in his mind.<br>
Resisting the urge to reach for his notebook beside her, he sat frozen.<br>
“Akira...”</p>

<p>Emiko turned her gaze from the screen to his profile.<br>
“Even plant gene expression changes unpredictably with the environment.<br>
Can human emotion—far more complex—really be expressed in equations?”<br>
“You’re right. That’s why... it needs even more complex equations—”</p>

<p>His voice grew tight, uncertainty seeping in.<br>
The scientist in him rejected half-formed images before they could become words.<br>
“A precise... nonlinear dynamic system... maybe that could—”<br>
His thoughts looped. Words failed.</p>

<p>The frustration of vision without language clouded his face.<br>
Emiko stood stiffly beside the desk, waiting.<br>
The silence between them deepened the distance in the room.<br>
Akira finally spoke.</p>

<p>“If this research succeeds—”<br>
“Again. Research?”<br>
She cut him off sharply, setting the mug down on the edge of the desk with a hard clink.<br>
Akira instinctively looked at the cup.</p>

<p>“Yes. Your life’s theme—research. I get it. I’m a researcher too.”<br>
She turned her back to him, arms spreading like a speaker on a stage.<br>
“Can a machine understand human emotion?<br>
Can it go beyond calculation—to empathy?”</p>

<p>“Yes—I, Akira Arato, am building the theory, the algorithm to make that possible.”<br>
“Emi, I—”<br>
He searched for words. None came.<br>
She remained turned away, shoulders slumped.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry. I’ve got to head to campus.”<br>
Her voice softened, fading.<br>
“Gotta get ready.”<br>
Hand on the doorknob, she added quietly:</p>

<p>“Next time’s... December, right? I’ll go ahead.<br>
Take care. Don’t forget your phone.”<br>
The door closed with a soft click.<br>
The latch echoed in the stillness.</p>

<p>Left alone, Akira picked up the notebook and stared at the open page.<br>
Then, slowly, he tore out the freshly written sheet and crushed it in both hands.<br>
“What I wanted to say to you was...”<br>
He let out a small breath and tossed the crumpled paper into the waste bin.</p>

<p>Maybe... Emiko understands me better than anyone else.<br>
Sipping cold coffee, he thought back on the past five days in Japan.<br>
He’d been at a full conference in Nagasaki, returning to Tokyo only yesterday.<br>
We barely talked about the future.</p>

<p>He imagined Emiko’s composed face.<br>
I thought I understood her. So I kept pushing, harder, deeper... but...<br>
They had been living together for five years.<br>
His San Jose lab position was for two.</p>

<p>The future was hazy.<br>
Emiko never complained.<br>
But... this couldn’t go on.<br>
Akira set the mug down and glanced at the bin.</p>

<p>Then, retrieving the crumpled page, he smoothed it carefully.<br>
Fingers traced the creases.<br>
He folded it neatly and crouched down.<br>
He gently placed the folded paper into the G3’s empty bay— <br>
into that unfilled space, like a name before it learns its meaning.</p>

<p>“A program to understand emotion... huh.”<br>
He let out a quiet laugh, almost to himself.<br>
Then he looked down at the soft-zip travel bag on the floor—just big enough for a laptop, shirts, and a week’s worth of conference notes.<br>
And he pulled the zipper closed.<br>
Sunlight from the early summer window stung his eyes.<br>
He closed them and whispered, almost in prayer:<br>
“But someday... I’ll get there. I swear.”</p>

<p>Two coffee cups, long gone cold, sat on opposite ends of the desk—<br>
like punctuation marks to a conversation unfinished.</p>
