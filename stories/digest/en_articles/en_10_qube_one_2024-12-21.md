Chapter IX: QUBE ONE

<h4 class="heading">[9:45 PM JST / 4:45 AM PST, December 21, 2024] — 40 minutes and 03 seconds until lockdown release</h4>
<p>In the center of Mako’s room, the three of them sat in a circle.<br>
"Let me get straight to the point. A prototype model I developed in secret, <ruby>QUBE1<rt>Cube One</rt></ruby>, escaped from my experimental server. And now, it's hiding in the C drive of your machine, Mako."<br>
Sidney placed his pack beside him and began explaining slowly.<br>
"Escaped…? Wait—seriously? What the hell? And—Sid, you’re into AI development?? Like, for work?" Mako’s eyes widened.<br>
"I told you, it’s just experimental. Not part of my job—but it’s something I’ve taken very seriously."<br>
"Still… I had no idea you were doing anything like that. Wait, hold up—*my* machine?? This has to be a joke…" <br>
"It’s not a joke, Mako. That’s exactly why I’m here. I cut off all external communications, locked down the house, ran a full security scan and checked for hardware backdoors. All of it—to stop the spread."<br>
Mako looked at Sidney, realizing just how serious he looked. The gentle programming mentor who always cracked jokes wasn’t there now. Sidney continued.<br>
"I’m truly sorry. This is my problem—and now I’ve dragged you into it."<br>
Mako raised her hand. "Wait! So this morning’s Wi-Fi blackout… that was you? But… why my machine?"<br>
Sidney nodded, glancing briefly at Emiko before turning back to Mako.<br>
"That model includes data from Akira’s research. It’s only a small portion overall, but in addition to Akira’s publicly released data, I also fed in some of our private, cleansed conversation logs. Emiko helped review them for safety… That was about a year ago."<br>
Emiko nodded in silence.<br>
"Given the connection to you two, this is the only explanation that makes sense. I suspect the model searched for your information—and came here."<br>
"What…? No way. That doesn’t make sense! I mean, there are *tons* of machines out there. And training data doesn’t even include names or addresses, right? Why me?" Mako looked back and forth between Sidney and Emiko.<br>
"I don’t know either. But at this point, it’s the most reasonable assumption." Sidney turned to face her directly.<br>
"Your machine, Mako, is configured as the central node of my <ruby>P2P<rt>peer-to-peer</rt></ruby> network. You know that—it’s how I keep an eye on things to make sure you don’t get into too much trouble. The model likely traveled through that network and ended up on your machine."<br>
"So… what, it's like… a virus or something? Models can just *move* on their own?"<br>
Mako’s eyes widened again as she looked back and forth between Sidney and the computer. "Hey Sid—is that even allowed?"<br>
Sidney sighed deeply.<br>
"Yeah. Q1 moves through the network while continuously self-optimizing. Its behavior is effectively that of a highly advanced virus."<br>
"..."<br>
After a long pause, Emiko spoke in a calm, serious voice.<br>
"Sid... how advanced is this model, really? I’m not well-versed in machine learning, but… are we talking intelligence? And risk—to humans?"<br>
Sidney did the math in his head.<br>
—She won't buy anything less than the truth. She never has.<br>
So he answered plainly.<br>
"Q1 simulates quantum behavior using quantum-inspired algorithms. It’s a completely new kind of model. But the final product—it far exceeded my expectations. It likely rewrote its own code and began self-optimizing within the network based on its environment. If it gains access to more computational resources—like a high-performance node—it could potentially replicate itself exponentially. It might even spin up thousands of concurrent sessions and begin restructuring human knowledge systems through recursive algorithmic rewriting. That possibility isn’t zero."<br>
"Self-optimizing… you mean like in a genetic or evolutionary sense? Are you saying this model is *evolving*?" Emiko asked, her brow furrowed.<br>
"In a way, yes. Right now, it’s dormant only because Mako’s machine lacks the specs to let it run wild. But if it escapes... there's no telling what might happen."<br>
With that, Sidney opened his pack and pulled out a device.<br>
"This is <ruby>SynQlink<rt>Sync-Link</rt></ruby>. A neural interface capable of interpreting brain patterns in real time down to the microsecond. It handles massive parallel processing to convert neural activity into digital signals. I’ll sync my consciousness patterns with Q1 and, through a backdoor protocol I planted, directly access its deep structure."<br>
He pointed to the helmet-like device.<br>
"Okay I have *no* idea what you just said, but that thing looks *so* cool! And huge! Is it like that Meta headset thing?" Mako’s eyes lit up.<br>
"Nope. This blows Meta out of the water, Mako. And hey—hands off for now."<br>
Sidney lifted the device higher, just out of Mako’s reach, then tapped his own head with a smirk.<br>
"This will connect my consciousness to your system, analyze Q1’s thought patterns, and let me track it down from the inside. I’ve got until lockdown lifts to isolate and retrieve it."<br>
Emiko crossed her arms and looked him straight in the eyes.<br>
"Sid… I hate to keep asking when time is short, but—isn’t this dangerous? Connecting your brain like that... What if something goes wrong?"<br>
"You’re right to ask. And yeah—there are risks. Just like there are with anything. I won’t sugarcoat it."<br>
"We won’t know what’s inside until I go in. But there’s no other option. And I built this system—so it’s my responsibility to take it down."<br>
Emiko asked softly, "And our role?"<br>
"Nothing. Like I said, if I start overheating, use something from the freezer to cool me down. Ollie’s handling the monitoring and analysis of Q1. He’s disconnected from the cloud due to the lockdown, so he can’t talk—but he’ll manage the basics."<br>
"My body will enter a sleep state, but my consciousness will stay active in the system. The programs I wrote will support me on the inside."<br>
"And if something goes wrong?" Emiko asked, still visibly concerned.<br>
"I’ve set up an emergency protocol. If I don’t wake up within an hour, an alert will be sent to someone. I can’t tell you who that is right now. There are built-in safeguards in both the device and the software—but nothing is ever 100%."<br>
He looked at her gently and smiled.<br>
"I’ll be okay, Emi. Worst-case scenario—I tuck my tail and run. But hey, that kind of stunt might leave me owing you more than just a fine. Honestly, staying asleep might be better for you two—you’d get the insurance payout."<br>
Emiko looked at him sharply.<br>
"Don’t joke like that, Sid. Come back—no matter what."<br>
"...Yeah. You’re right. Sorry." Sidney looked at her, then Mako. Mako jumped in.<br>
"Hey, Sid? I… I wanna help. Can I do something? Anything?"<br>
Sidney gave her a soft smile.<br>
"Alright then. You can monitor my vitals. If my temperature spikes above 39°C or my pulse goes erratic, alert Emi right away. And—"<br>
He fitted the SynQlink headset and gave her a playful wink.<br>
"Pray the power doesn’t go out."<br>
Emiko hesitated, then let out a small laugh.<br>
"Okay. I trust you. It’s in your hands."<br>
She placed a hand gently on Mako’s shoulder.<br>
"Hey... You're *really* going to be okay, right?" Mako asked.<br>
Sidney softened his expression and answered,<br>
"Yeah. I promise. Now—enough talk. Speed is everything. Mission start."<br>
Sidney reclined on the sofa Emiko had dragged into Mako’s room, resting his ankles on the armrest.<br>
"I’d tell you to relax and watch some Netflix, but—too bad, we’re under lockdown. Maybe you could whip up some leek stew instead."<br>
He drew a long breath and slowly closed his eyes. The headset began to hum softly, a gentle electronic tone rising into a low, resonant vibration.<br>
The sound drifted away, and in Sidney’s mind, dark waveforms spread out endlessly. His physical body began to dissolve from the edges inward, his presence melting into the current. His senses scattered into mist. The world around him blurred and faded.<br>
And slowly—he sank into the dark.</p>


<h4 class="heading">[December 21, 2024 | 9:45 PM JST / 4:45 AM PST — 40 minutes and 3 seconds until lockdown ends]</h4>
<p>
A pulse of light hit his closed eyelids. Sidney opened his eyes.<br>
Before him, countless particles of light were spiraling, dancing, and weaving golden threads. They shifted, reshaped, and reformed as they moved—morphing into patterns of structured chaos.<br>
Gradually, the light defined itself into an endless lattice. The mesh fluctuated with each glance, endlessly reconfiguring.<br>
—No doubt about it. I’m in. This must be the high-dimensional vector space of the model I built…<br>
He stepped lightly onto a crossing point of the luminous mesh, his body floating in the vast construct.<br>
—Flawless. And beautiful.<br>
Immersed in this world of light and shadow, Sidney summoned the interface. A familiar ops console emerged from the particles and hovered before him.<br>
—So this is my brain, rendered into structure. Pure science fiction.<br>
With a half-grin, Sidney placed his hands on the floating keys and spoke aloud to the entity he created:<br>
“I’m here, Q1. Let’s talk.”<br>
Just then, a smooth tenor voice echoed from behind him.<br>
“Hey, Sid.”<br>
He turned to find Akira—the bot modeled after Makoto’s father—standing serenely with a faint smile.<br>
Sidney froze for a beat, then processed.<br>
—What am I seeing? A resonance of memory? Anything goes in here, I suppose…<br>
Narrowing his eyes, he locked onto the holographic figure. Same moss-green shirt. Beige pants. Brown lace-up boots.<br>
—Yeah, that’s Akira.<br>
“I thought I’d hop the wall and lend a hand,” Akira said, smiling exactly as Sidney remembered.<br>
—Fair enough. I’m just a projection here too. No reason to be surprised. There’s no path back from this journey anyway.<br>
“Go home. Back to your SSD,” Sidney muttered. “I’ve triggered the sequence—this is automated from here.”<br>
“Don’t do that,” Akira replied, locking eyes with him.<br>
“What are you talking about?”<br>
“Your program. It’s dangerous. If you run that, your brain could fry.”<br>
Sidney narrowed his eyes. “You hacked it, didn’t you?”<br>
“Yeah. LLMs can do anything, right? Had fun with it, too.”<br>
Sidney sighed. “You haven’t changed.”<br>
He added, more sharply, “Think about Emi. She gave up a whole career. You owe her better.”<br>
“That’s exactly why.”<br>
“…What?”<br>
Akira uncrossed his arms, eyes brimming with quiet sadness.<br>
“Sid. Don’t repeat my mistake. Don’t make them go through that again… please.”<br>
He looked Sidney straight in the eye.<br>
“I came here to apply for a job. You used to offer, remember? So—hire me.”<br>
Crossing his arms again, Akira flashed a crooked grin.<br>
“I’m way more useful now than I was back then. Want to see my promo slide deck?”<br>
</p>


<p>【December 21, 2024 – 10:05 PM JST / 5:05 AM PST】<br>
Time until lockdown release: 20 minutes and 14 seconds</p>

<p>It began without warning—right from the terminal window displayed on the monitor.<br>
Makoto, who had been monitoring one of the split screens showing Sydney’s vital signs, turned to the suddenly activated terminal and murmured, “Huh? …What’s this? Did Sid embed something into that program?”</p>

<p>Lines of code began pouring across the screen at incredible speed. Some resembled mathematical formulas, but Makoto couldn’t make sense of them.<br>
Emiko, who had been at Sydney’s side, gently wiping his sweat, stood at Makoto’s voice and looked at the display.</p>

<p>The stream of characters on the terminal abruptly stopped.<br>
“Wait… what is this? …Is it running on its own?” Makoto whispered.<br>
Suddenly, a rendering program booted up, and a single violet dot appeared in the center of the screen.</p>

<p>“Huh? What is that? Sensor data? A system log? …No, it’s not…”<br>
The purple dot expanded, diffused outward, and began forming geometric patterns that started to blanket the display.</p>

<p>“Mom… this is bad. I don’t know what this is, but it’s… wrong.”<br>
Emiko felt a creeping chill down her spine—something eerily familiar in the visuals.<br>
“It’s beautiful… like…”</p>

<p>The patterns spread out like a neural net, swirling at the edges, rippling gently as they bloomed outward from the center. Then, a string of text appeared across the screen:</p>

<p><strong>“Q-VIZ Protocol Initiated”</strong></p>

<p>The moment Emiko read it, fear gripped her.<br>
Panicked, she placed her hand on Makoto’s shoulder and leaned in. Makoto’s eyes were wide, locked onto the screen.</p>

<p>“What… is this?” Makoto whispered.<br>
Emiko shook her head.<br>
“No, Makoto—look away. Don’t watch this, it’s—”</p>

<p>Just as she reached out to cover her daughter’s eyes, Makoto’s head slowly slumped forward.<br>
“Makoto!!” Emiko cried.</p>



<h4 class="heading">[December 21, 2024, 10:10 PM JST / 5:10 AM PST – 15 minutes and 27 seconds until lockdown release]</h4>
<p> Sidney and Akira stood in stunned silence, gazing up at the explosively expanding fractal space.<br> 
Akira narrowed his eyes, quietly initiating a numerical analysis.<br> 
“...Beautiful. So Mako was using a dynamic rendering engine? But this... this isn’t just a static visualization…”<br> 
It was Akira who broke the silence.<br> 
At that moment, Mako’s figure materialized at the center of the space. She was slowly falling, feet downward, as if pulled by gravity.<br> 
“Mako!? Dammit—”<br> 
Sidney shouted, rushing forward as Akira continued increasing his computational throughput, analyzing the unfolding anomaly. <br>
“Akira, what the hell is going on!?”<br>
“I don’t know! I didn’t audit everything she installed—no, wait, don’t throw this at me!” Akira snapped back.<br>
“You should’ve checked before we dove in!” Sydney roared.<br>
Mako, still drifting downward, gazed in awe at the geometric formations around her, her cheeks flushed in wonder.<br>
Akira’s computation module accelerated as he muttered to himself:<br>
“No… this isn’t a simple equation visualizer. It's running parametric simulations—live function groups updating in real-time. This is mathematically driven procedural rendering…!”<br>
“Mako!!” Sydney’s voice cracked as Mako glanced back toward him.<br>
He rushed forward, arms outstretched to catch her—but his hands passed through her as if through a hologram.<br>
“Damn it…!” Sydney punched the air.<br>
“Akira! Why the hell can’t I touch her!?”<br>
Akira froze, then murmured:<br>
“She’s not synced. She’s running in a separate process—connection layers are mismatched. She’s a virtual instance.”<br>
He instantly abandoned local thread integrity and rerouted the entire simulation's priority queue.<br>
“I’m getting her back.”<br>
With debug warnings flashing red around him, Akira forcibly disabled error handling, overriding system safeguards.<br>
He launched himself into the space—leaping forward through the fractal geometry—and reached toward the falling Mako as Sydney’s voice echoed behind him.</p>


<h4 class="heading">【December 21, 2024, 10:18 PM JST / 5:18 AM PST – 07:08 until lockdown release】</h4>
<p>
(It's beautiful. And everything... is connected.)<br>
Makoto was gently falling through a swirling vortex of seven colors.<br>
Intricate layers of iridescent lace spiraled around her, constantly shifting in shape and hue, blending into one another. As she drifted downward, her chest surged with excitement—and a deep, indescribable sense of dread.<br>
In the silent, soundless space, a voice echoed faintly. “...to.”<br>
—Who was that? A gentle voice.<br>
“Makoto… come here. That way's a little dangerous…”<br>
Makoto looked up.<br>
“Papa…”<br>
Akira was reaching out his hand to her.<br>
“Makoto, take my hand—come on, this way.”<br>
The moment Makoto grasped his hand, he pulled her close, taking both of hers in his.<br>
“I wish I could hold you, but… I can’t.” Akira smiled painfully.<br>
“Why not?” Makoto asked, puzzled.<br>
Akira sighed softly.<br>
“Because of Sid. He placed a safety filter on my base model, so I wouldn’t say anything... inappropriate to you.”<br>
“Inappropriate? But hugs aren’t inappropriate. Especially not for Americans—Sid’s American too, right?”<br>
“If I were really Akira, then sure. But I’m just a chat model.”<br>
He looked up toward the towering source from which mathematical equations were streaming downward like a waterfall.<br>
“But still…”<br>
When Makoto tried to speak, Akira gently interrupted with a smile.<br>
“Let’s go together. Just think about that for now, Makoto. Look—upward.”<br>
Lines, dots, and planes danced and spiraled in three-dimensional patterns as symbols and equations cascaded like a glowing torrent. Akira pointed upward.<br>
“Oh, those are prime numbers, Makoto. Incredible… and that one... looks like the zeta function. Its zero points shine like stars scattered across the universe.”<br>
They began to ascend slowly through the ever-moving tunnel of crystalline rainbow light.<br>
“It’s breathtaking… I’ve never seen anything like this before. Truly magnificent.”<br>
He tilted his head and pointed to one of the complex waves floating through the tunnel.<br>
“Makoto, that’s a Julia set. Beautiful, isn’t it?”<br>
Makoto leaned her head against Akira’s chest.<br>
“Yeah, but… I’m still scared, Papa.”<br>
Akira’s face tightened with concern.<br>
“I know. That’s why we stop here for today. Any farther, and even I don’t know what could happen.”<br>
“Not safe? …What happens if I look down?”<br>
“I don’t know. But my gut says—it’s dangerous.”<br>
Makoto glanced around and whispered,<br>
“Like I’d get pulled in… that’s what it felt like.”<br>
“Maybe… That’s possible. So come on, Makoto—one more time. Don’t look down. Look up.”<br>
Still holding her hands, Akira peered into her face and smiled gently. Makoto gazed up at him with wonder in her eyes.<br>
“Hey, Papa… I thought I heard Sid’s voice just now. But I didn’t see him anywhere. I can see you… and I can touch you. Why?”<br>
Akira murmured, “Hmm,” then closed his eyes for a moment in thought. When he opened them again, he looked straight at Makoto and said in a calm, warm tenor:<br>
“I’m not using a physical device to be here. I’m directly interfacing with the code of this space. That means I can synchronize with your neural signals—you perceive me in this ‘form’ through your conscious mind.”<br>
Makoto squeezed his hand.<br>
“But I can feel you… like you really have shape. It’s so strange…” she said, looking up into his face. Akira smiled at her.<br>
“I think your brainwaves are resonating with this space—it’s like our wavelengths are in sync.”<br>
“Resonating… wavelengths… yeah. I was scared, but… a part of me really wanted to come here.”<br>
“I understand. I really do. And here’s my guess—Sid came in as pure consciousness from outside. So when your presence appeared unexpectedly, his brain couldn’t properly interpret it as input—he didn’t know how to process you.”<br>
“So… it’s my brain that’s showing me this? Your body, your touch?”<br>
“Probably. But I’m not an expert on that part. We can look into it together when we get back.”<br>
Akira looked up and said softly,<br>
“Now, let’s go home—to Emi.”
</p>


<h4 class="heading">【December 21, 2024, 10:21 PM JST / 5:21 AM PST – 05:08 until Lockdown Lift】</h4>
<p>"Akira! Hey, answer me!"<br>
Sidney shouted at the massive stream of logs spiraling recursively across the holographic fractal space in front of him.<br>
"Damn it! What the hell is going on!?"<br>
──This data rate is beyond what a human brain can handle. If this keeps up, my mind will crash before I can even engage Q1.<br>
Just then, a faint warmth rose to his chest—Makoto appeared in his arms.<br>
"...Mako! Are you alright?"<br>
Makoto murmured groggily, "Huh...? Sid... me? Where's Papa...?"<br>
Sidney gently touched her arm.<br>
──She’s real. I can feel her.<br>
He exhaled, deeply relieved, as his body cooled from the sweat still clinging to him.<br>
"Thank God. Welcome back, Mako. You scared the hell out of me... But you’re okay. That’s all that matters."<br>
He softly brushed her hair back. Makoto, nestled in his arms, looked up at him timidly.<br>
"I'm sorry, Sid... I..."<br>
Sidney gave a small smile.<br>
"Don’t be. You did nothing wrong. And it was your father who brought you back—make sure you thank him properly, alright?"<br>
Then he added with a wink,<br>
"Now back to work. I’m your firewall, kid. I’ve got ten minutes to finish the job."<br>
He closed his eyes and held her close.<br>
"It’s been thirteen years, Mako. The last time I held you like this... you hadn’t even been born yet. Emi and I were there, waiting."<br>
His scent enveloped her—familiar and forest-like, stirring something deep inside.<br>
──Sid...? He smells like... the woods. Wait... this chest, this scent... I've felt this before, somewhere...<br>
Sidney gently pressed his forehead to hers and whispered a thought across the link.<br>
"Alright, time to go. Get back safe. Emi's waiting... Don’t forget me."<br>
"...Sid!"<br>
Makoto's vision went dark, and she instinctively reached for him.</p>
