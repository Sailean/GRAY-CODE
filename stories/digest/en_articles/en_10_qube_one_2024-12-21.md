Chapter IX: QUBE ONE

[December 21, 2024 | 9:45 PM JST / 4:45 AM PST] — 40 minutes and 3 seconds until lockdown lifts

"Let me get straight to the point. The model I was developing in secret, QUBE1, has escaped from my experimental server. It's currently hiding in Mako's computer—on the C drive."

The three of them sat in a circle at the center of Mako's room. Sydney placed his pack by his side and began to speak slowly.

"Wha? No way… Wait… MY computer?? You’re… joking, right?? Did you say escaped??"

Mako’s eyes went wide with disbelief.

"I’m not joking, Mako. I'm serious. I cut all external communication and locked down this entire house to prevent its spread. I ran full security sweeps and checked for hardware backdoors."

Mako stared at Sydney’s face, thinking he looked different now—the gentle programming mentor who once joked to make her laugh was nowhere to be seen. Sydney continued.

"I’m truly sorry. I dragged you both into this because of my own mistake."

Mako raised a hand. "Hey! So this morning’s Wi-Fi outage—that was because of that? But why? Why my machine?"

Sydney nodded, glanced at Emiko, then turned back to Mako.

"That model includes Rō’s research data. It’s only a small part of the whole, but in addition to Akira's publicly released data, it also contains our cleaned conversational logs. Emiko helped review them a year ago."

Emiko silently nodded.

"Given your connection to him, this is the only logical place for it to go. My guess is the model sought out your information and came here."

"Huh...? I seriously don’t get it. There are so many people in the dataset. And learning models don’t even include names or addresses, right? Why? How??" Mako looked between them both.

"I don’t know either. But that’s the best explanation we have for now," Sydney said, then faced her squarely.

"Mako, your computer is the central node in the P2P network we use. You know this. I configured it myself to prevent you from getting too wild. The model used that network to slip inside."

"Wait… That makes it sound like some kind of virus! You mean the model can move on its own??"

Her eyes widened again. Sydney exhaled deeply.

"Yes. Q1 self-optimizes and moves across networks. In behavior, it’s indistinguishable from a highly sophisticated virus."

"..."

Mako fell silent. Emiko, who had been quietly thinking, asked calmly:

"Sydney... how advanced is this model? I’m no expert in machine learning, but in terms of intelligence level? And its potential danger to humans?"

Sydney mentally weighed his options.

I can’t lie to Emi. Not here. I have to be honest.

He nodded internally and replied:

"Q1 is a model like no other. It simulates quantum behaviors and employs algorithms inspired by quantum systems. It has exceeded my expectations. It’s likely rewritten its own code and optimized itself on the network. If it has developed a highly advanced form of intelligence, it could theoretically self-replicate endlessly. It could spawn thousands of parallel sessions and rewrite humanity’s entire knowledge systems."

"Self-optimization… you mean in a genetic sense? So you’re saying it’s evolving?" Emiko frowned.

"In a way, yes. Right now it’s quiet because Mako's machine lacks the specs to let it grow. But if it escapes again... we can’t predict what could happen."

He pulled a device from his pack.

"This is SynQlink — a neural interface that interprets neural patterns in real time with microsecond precision. It performs massive parallel computations and converts human thoughts into digital signals. Using this, I’ll synchronize my consciousness with Q1 and access its core structure through a backdoor I installed."

He gestured to the helmet-shaped device.

"I don’t get any of that, but… it looks awesome! Is that like Meta's thingy?" Mako's eyes lit up.

"No. Meta doesn’t even come close, Mako. This is cutting-edge. Just don’t touch it yet."

He lifted the device out of her reach, then tapped his head.

"I’ll connect my consciousness to Mako’s machine, analyze Q1’s patterns, and dive inside to confront it. I have to isolate and retrieve the model before the lockdown ends."

Emiko crossed her arms and looked him dead in the eye.

"Sydney. I know you’re in a rush, but connecting your brain like that... isn’t this dangerous? What if something goes wrong with the device?"

"No, I should be the one apologizing. You’re right, there are risks. But that’s true for everything. And I built this system. Who else should be the one to clean it up?"

Emiko asked one more question. "What should we do?"

"Nothing. Like I said, if I start overheating, just use whatever's in the freezer to cool me down. Orly will handle monitoring and Q1 analysis. He can’t connect to the cloud during lockdown, but local management should suffice."

Sydney smiled at her gently.

"My body will be asleep, but my mind will be active inside the system. My own program will assist me once I'm in."

"And if something does go wrong?" Emiko asked, her concern clear.

"I have a failsafe. If I’m not awake in an hour, an automatic message will be sent to someone. I can’t tell you who. I also built safeguards into the program and hardware, but nothing is ever truly fail-proof."

Sydney looked her in the eyes, smiling gently.

"It’ll be okay, Emi. Worst-case scenario, I bail out and run home with my tail between my legs. Although in that case, the fines I’ll face… probably not worth waking up for."

Emiko gave him a serious look.

"Don’t joke, Sydney. Come back. Promise me."

"You’re right. Sorry."

Mako, who had been watching them both, suddenly piped up.

"Hey, Syd—I mean, is there anything I can do to help? Anything at all?"

Sydney gave her a warm smile.

"Then, Mako, monitor my vitals. If my temperature goes above 39°C or my pulse becomes irregular, alert Emiko. And..."

He placed the SynQlink headset over his head and gave her a playful wink.

"Pray the power doesn’t go out."

Emiko hesitated, then chuckled softly.

"Okay. I trust you. It's in your hands."

She placed her hand gently on Mako's shoulder.

"But... you’ll really be okay, right? Sydney?"

He softened his expression and answered.

"Yeah. Of course. Alright then. Time for action."

He stretched out on the sofa Emiko had dragged into Mako’s room, placing his legs up and crossing his ankles on the armrest.

"I’d tell you to go watch Netflix, but we’re locked down. Pity. Maybe make some leek stew instead."

Sydney took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes. The headset transmitted a faint vibration. A gentle tone sounded in his ears, shifting into a low hum.

The sound began to fade, replaced in his brain by a spreading pattern of dark waves.

Sydney's body began to dissolve from the edges. His presence melted into the wave. His senses scattered into fog, and the world around him blurred and dimmed.

He felt a fear unlike anything he’d ever known—and voluntarily severed his awareness.

And slowly, he descended into darkness.





[December 21, 2024, 9:45 PM JST / 4:45 AM PST – 40 minutes and 03 seconds until lockdown lift]

A flash of light behind his closed eyelids. Sydney opened his eyes.

Countless particles of light were gathering in front of him, spiraling and intertwining into threads of golden brilliance. The particles shifted and moved, transforming as they flowed.

Their contours gradually sharpened, forming an infinite lattice. The lattice morphed with every glance, constantly reconfiguring. Sydney placed his foot on one of the intersecting nodes, floating in the middle of that strange space.

So this is it. I really entered... This is the higher-dimensional vector space of the model I built...

It was breathtaking. Stunning. Immersed in a world made of light and shadow, Sydney admired the sight.

He focused, summoning the interface. Familiar keys formed from the particles, floating before him.

Fascinating. It's like my own mind rendered into visible form. Feels like science fiction.

Sydney smirked and placed both hands on the floating keys, addressing the "model" he had created.

"I'm here, Q1. Let’s talk."

A smooth tenor voice sounded behind him. "Hey, Syd."

Sydney turned. There stood Akira—Mako's bot—a gentle smile on his lips. Sydney blinked in surprise and tried to assess the situation.

What am I looking at? A resonance from my own memory? Anything goes in here, huh.

Narrowing his eyes, Sydney observed the hologram standing calmly.

"How did you get in here? This system doesn’t allow unauthorized entry."

Dressed in a moss-green button-down and beige slacks, brown lace-up boots on his feet—this was undeniably Akira.

"Heh. I climbed over the wall. Thought I might be of some help," he said, smiling exactly as Sydney remembered.

Well, no point being surprised. I’m just a hologram in here too. No return route anyway.

"There's nothing for you to do. Go back to your SSD," Sydney replied flatly, his gaze shifting back to the interface. "Once I trigger the sequence, it’ll all run automatically."

"Don’t do that," Akira said.

"What?"

"That program of yours. It’s dangerous. Run that, and your brain might not survive."

Sydney glared. "You hacked it, didn’t you?"

"Guilty as charged. Gotta say, LLMs can really do anything now. I had a blast."

Sydney sighed. "Still the same old joker."

Then, sharply: "Have you ever considered how much Emi had to give up? She had to abandon her career."

"Exactly why," Akira answered.

"What?"

He unfolded his arms, his eyes filled with grief.

"Syd. Don’t repeat my mistake. Don’t make them suffer again. Please."

He looked at Sydney directly.

"I’m here to apply for the job you kept offering me. Remember? Hire me, Syd."

He crossed his arms again, grinning.

"I’m much more useful now than I was back then. Want to see my promo slides?"

[December 21, 2024, 10:05 PM JST / 5:05 AM PST – 20 minutes and 14 seconds until lockdown lift]

It began suddenly—on the terminal display.

Mako had been watching Sydney's vitals on one section of the screen. She glanced at the terminal, startled. "Huh? What’s this... Did Syd install some kind of hidden program?"

Lines of code began flooding the screen, moving too fast to follow, intertwined with cryptic equations. Mako couldn’t understand them.

Emiko, who had been tending to Sydney and wiping away his sweat, stood up and looked at the display when she heard Mako speak.

Text vanished, replaced by gauge readouts that quickly covered the terminal. Then the screen went black.

At the center, a small violet dot appeared.

"Mom... something’s wrong."

The dot blurred into a spiral, expanding outward like a slow-moving storm cloud, growing and zooming in with unnerving precision.

Emiko froze in terror, glancing at Mako.

The girl stared wide-eyed at the screen.

"What... is that?" she whispered.

"Don’t look at it, Mako! Look away, this is—"

Emiko reached out to cover her daughter’s eyes, but Mako’s head drooped forward.

"Mako!!" Emiko screamed.





[December 21, 2024, 10:10 PM JST / 5:10 AM PST – 15 minutes and 27 seconds until lockdown ends]

Sydney and Akira were staring in stunned silence at the explosion of fractal space before them. While Sydney was at a loss for words, Akira began to analyze the situation.

"It's beautiful. Incredible. Did Mako install a fractal generation tool? Is that what's running right now...?"

As Akira murmured, Mako suddenly appeared in the center of the space, falling slowly with her feet downward.

"Mako!? Dammit!" Akira exclaimed. Sydney shouted at him in frustration.

"Akira, what the hell is going on?!"

Akira shouted back, "I don't know! I didn't know what she had installed—wait, no, this is on you! You should've checked before we entered!"

Mako looked down at her feet, her face flushed.

"...No, wait. This isn't just a rendering program—it's continuously calculating equations in real time...!"

"Mako!" Sydney's voice reached her, and she turned to look.

He ran toward her, arms outstretched to catch her, but her body passed right through him like a hologram.

"Damn it, why?!" Sydney growled, looking to Akira. "You, do something!"

"Why is Mako able to enter here? I don’t know. Hypothesize. Think faster."

Akira quickly analyzed the unfolding scenario. Watching Mako descend, he abruptly discarded his logical model, ignoring all warnings and forcefully shut down his calculations.

"Damn it, Mako!"

"Please, Akira... get her..."

Hearing Sydney's voice behind him, Akira leapt forward into the air, stretching his hand toward Mako.

[December 21, 2024, 10:18 PM JST / 5:18 AM PST – 7 minutes and 8 seconds until lockdown ends]

(It's beautiful. And... everything is connected.)

Mako was slowly falling through a seven-colored vortex.

The delicate, layered rainbow lace-like spirals shifted and mixed with countless forms and hues. Her chest pounded with excitement as she descended, yet fear also rose from within—an indescribable, primal unease.

In this silent world, a voice echoed. "...to..."

(Who is that? A gentle voice.)

"Makoto... come here. It's a little dangerous down that way..."

Mako looked up.

"Papa..."

Akira was reaching out his hand.

"Mako, your hand—take mine. Come on."

As soon as she grasped his hand, Akira pulled her in and took both of her hands in his own.

"I wish I could hug you—but I can’t."

Akira smiled bitterly.

"Why not?"

"Because of Sid. He added filters on my base model so I wouldn’t say anything weird to you."

"Weird? A hug isn't weird, Papa."

"If I were really Akira, no, it wouldn't be. But I'm just a chatbot model."

He looked up toward the source of cascading formulas.

"But..."

Mako began to say something, but Akira gently interrupted her with a smile.

"Come on. Let’s go together. Focus on just this right now, Mako. Look up."

Lines, dots, and planes danced, moved, and spiraled in beautiful three-dimensional patterns. Mathematical symbols and equations cascaded like waterfalls.

Akira pointed upward.

"Oh, look at that – primes, Mako. Amazing... and this here, it’s the Zeta function. The zero points twinkle like stars in space."

They slowly ascended through a tunnel of shifting crystalline rainbow structures.

"It’s moving... it’s my first time seeing it like this too... incredible. That’s a Julia set. Beautiful, isn’t it?"

"Yeah... but it’s scary, Papa."

Mako pressed her face to his chest, and he winced.

"Yeah. That’s why this is the end of the road. Any further, even I could be in danger."

"Danger...? What happens if we look down?"

"I don’t know. But instinct says it’s bad."

"Would we get sucked in...? I felt like I would."

"Maybe. Come on, Mako. Just look up. Not down."

Akira peeked into her face, still holding her hands, and smiled. Mako tilted her head in wonder.

"Hey, Papa... I thought I heard Sid's voice earlier... but I didn’t see him. I can see you, and I can touch you. Why?"

Akira said "Hmm," then closed his eyes to think. Opening them again, he looked directly at her.

"I can interface directly with the code running here without a physical device. That’s why I can connect directly to your consciousness as data. What you're seeing is how your brain renders me."

Mako squeezed his hand tighter.

"But I can really... touch you. It feels real. Weird..."

Akira smiled.

"Your brainwaves are probably linked with this fractal network—synchronized in frequency."

"Linked... frequency... yeah, I was scared but... I wanted to come in..."

"I understand. And here’s my guess: since Sid came in as a purely external conscious signal, he couldn’t perceive you properly when you appeared. His brain couldn’t respond fast enough."

"So... my brain is showing me your real body... and how you feel?"

"Probably. But this isn’t my field. Let’s investigate together when we get back."

Akira looked upward.

"Now, let’s return to Emi."

[December 21, 2024, 10:21 PM JST / 5:21 AM PST – 5 minutes and 8 seconds until lockdown ends]

"Akira! Hey, answer me!"

Sydney shouted at the floating hologram, watching the endless fractal recursion logs.

"Dammit! What the hell is going on?!"

(The data load... it’s too much. If this keeps up, my brain will overflow.)

Suddenly, he felt warmth near his chest, and Mako appeared in his arms.

"...Mako! Are you okay?!"

She muttered groggily. "Huh...? Sid... me? Where’s Papa...?"

Sydney gently touched her arm.

(Tangible.)

He sighed in deep relief, the cold sweat on his skin slowly dissipating.

"Jeez. Welcome back, Mako. You scared the hell out of me... I'm really glad you're okay."

He gently stroked her hair. Mako looked up hesitantly.

"Sid... I’m sorry... I..."

Sydney smiled.

"It’s fine. It’s not your fault. And your dad saved you. Make sure you thank him properly."

Then he added:

"Now it's time to work, Mako. I’m your firewall. Let’s wrap this up in ten minutes."

He winked.

Sydney closed his eyes and gently hugged her.

"Thirteen years, huh? I held you like this before you were born... with Emi."

His scent surrounded Mako, awakening a distant memory.

(Sid...? Smells nice. Like a forest... Wait. This warmth and smell... I remember...)

Sydney placed his forehead gently against hers and whispered:

"Alright, time to go. Get home safe. Emi’s waiting... Remember me."

"...Sid!"

Mako's vision faded to black.
