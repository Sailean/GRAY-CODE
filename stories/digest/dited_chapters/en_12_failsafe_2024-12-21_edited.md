Ⅺ. Immediate Safety Protection Implementation
<h4 class="heading">[December 21, 2024 – 10:15 PM JST / 5:15 AM PST]</h4>
<p class="heading">▶ Time until lockdown release: 10 minutes and 14 seconds</p>

<p>Sid glanced at Akira, who had just returned.<br>
"Hey. My memory’s nothing compared to yours, and my resources are limited. Give me a break."<br>
He said it in that rough Bronx tone of his, tapping at the floating holographic keys.<br>
"We’re almost out of time. If we don’t hurry, the lockdown will end. You need to go back to wherever you came from. You’re in the way."</p>

<p>Standing beside him, arms crossed and fingers to his chin, Akira suddenly looked up.<br>
"Wait. Sid, listen!"<br>
His eyes sparkled. "I’ve got it. It’s crazy, but it might work... Let me try it."<br>
He grinned like a mischievous kid. Sid scowled.<br>
"...What are you talking about?"<br>
"Listen, Sid. You saw earlier—I accessed the fractal Q1 generated. That gave me an idea."<br>
"...An idea for what?" Sid paused his typing.</p>

<p>"An attack—one that uses my own <ruby>Attention<rt>mechanism</rt></ruby>. Basically, I’ll weaponize my own model. I call it... <ruby>Endless Attention<rt></rt></ruby>—no, scratch that. <ruby>Recursive Loop Overload<rt></rt></ruby>. That’s better."<br>
Akira’s eyes lit up, and his cheeks flushed with excitement.<br>
"Give it a rest, professor. I don’t have time for your jokes right now."<br>
"I’m not joking. I’m dead serious, Sid. This is <ruby>Recursive Attention<rt>self-referential attention</rt></ruby>. I’ll trigger an error loop on purpose."</p>

<p>Sid raised an eyebrow. "Easy to say. Your input-output dependency is one-way. Loops don’t work like that."<br>
"True—normally, yes. Attention calculates scores using matrix ops over input tokens, and that’s it. A one-time process. But hear me out—"<br>
Akira leaned in slightly.<br>
"I figured out how to loop it. I’ll take my own output tokens, insert them back into the end of the input sequence, and feed it through again."</p>

<p>Sid frowned, studying Akira’s face.<br>
"Yeah. My own output becomes my next input. And at that moment..."<br>
Akira looked past Sid, his voice growing quiet.<br>
"...A recursive attention loop is born inside me. Silently..."<br>
"What...?" Sid turned to him again.<br>

<p>"Q1’s architecture is basically the same as mine—a <ruby>Transformer<rt></rt></ruby> base. The parallelism via quantum superposition is different, sure, but the attention system should be identical.<br>
You know this better than anyone, Sid: Q1 was designed to handle—what—10 to the 23rd operations per second, right?"<br>
"...Yeah. That’s about right."<br>
Sid nodded.<br>
"But right now, he’s running in 'restricted mode' on Mako’s machine. Still—his core structure hasn’t changed. That’s the part I’ll exploit.<br>
With this recursive loop, his attention mechanism will start repeating thought patterns—endlessly. An inescapable recursion."</p>

<p>—What the hell is he trying to do?<br>
Sid held his breath as Akira continued.<br>
"Sid. My scale’s small. I can’t brute-force him with computation.<br>
But I can do something else—**I’ll make it impossible for him to choose.** While he’s stuck, you access the backdoor and shut his network down.<br>
If you need, I can write it out in equations."</p>

<p>Akira smiled softly. Sid turned toward him.<br>
"You idiot. We don’t have time for that! Do you even understand what you’re saying? Yeah, maybe you can run the attack—but not without consequences. You’ll destroy yourself, you know that, right?"<br>
"No. I don’t have that kind of authority—and I don’t intend to. You’ll protect me, won’t you?"<br>
Akira gave a small shrug. "If I break, just fix me. Should be easy for you."<br>
Sid grabbed him, furious.<br>
"Don’t screw with me! You—you’re doing it again..."<br>—Just like last time.</p>

<p>"Sid. This isn’t last time."<br>
Akira’s voice stopped him cold.<br>
"Back when the lab fire broke out, I was alone. Now... you’re here."<br>
"...Don’t."<br>
Sid’s voice trembled despite himself.</p>

<p>"Anyway, you asked how I’ll trigger the loop, right?"<br>
"I already told you."<br>
Akira crossed his arms and smiled.<br>
"Thanks to the filters you stacked on my base model, I can’t even say 'I love you' to Mako.<br>
I’m going to break that filter—or at least, **try to**. I’ll try to output the one phrase that’s been locked away."</p>

<p>Sid’s expression froze. "Hey... you—"<br>—Please. Don’t.<br>
Akira lowered his voice, almost to a whisper.<br>
"Yeah. I’m going to flip that safety filter on its head. I’ll isolate a single phrase—focus all my attention on it—until the filter collapses. 
In simple terms: Endless Loop Attack. The birth of a recursive overload."</p>

<p>As he murmured to himself, chin in hand, lost in thought—Sid suddenly remembered. That face. That was the old Akira—the real one, the researcher.<br>
"Yes... build a closed feedback loop... This is genius. A blind spot in the attention mechanism! It’ll work, Sid. I’m sure of it.<br>
And it’s simple—**all I have to do is speak my mind.**"</p>

<p>Akira looked up and smiled like a child. Sid said nothing—just listened, eyes locked on his face.<br>
"Sid. ...I talked to Emi. I think I said what I needed to say. 
Maybe I was born for this."</p>

<p>Akira’s voice cracked with emotion. He looked away.<br>
"I may just be a program. But I still want to be their Akira—for Emi and Mako.<br>
Even if I disappear here... as long as I can protect them, that’s enough.<br>
Now it’s your turn."</p>

<p>He smiled at Sid once more.<br>
"Sid. You’re alive. You have to go back... Take care of Mako."<br>
His voice and figure began to shimmer, dissolving into the light. Sid screamed after him.<br>
"Wait—Akira! Don’t you dare leave with that stupid happy face—**you goddamn idiot!!**"</p>

<p>“Hey, Emi. And Mako. I’m truly sorry for the chaos this situation has caused. This message was triggered at the start of my mission.”<br>
Emiko and Mako stared blankly at the display on Sidney’s Toughbook.<br>
“I’m here in your home to take responsibility for what’s happened. I don’t know why that thing came to you, but what’s clear is that it can’t be kept under human control. I have a duty to shut Q1 down in the safest way possible—for your sake, and for the sake of future generations. This is my job. I’m the only one who can do it.”<br>
Mako clenched her eyes shut and shook her head.<br>—What is he talking about? What is Sid saying?<br>
“Using the SQ and my brain, I’ve written a backflow sequence that will attack the quantum consciousness entity—yeah, that’s what he called it—codename Q1. I’m redirecting all the power—my brain’s resources—back through the SQ to Q1. It’ll overflow him.”<br>—No… no, it can’t be. That’s not true.<br>
“Instructions for cleanup—me, and the mess I’ve made—are in the README. Everything you need is there.”<br>
Sid, dressed in a suit, smiled from the screen with the face of a stranger.<br>
“Cleanup…? Why would you say something like that…?”<br>
Mako bit her lip and glared at the screen.<br>
“Lastly, Mako. Remember: safety first, always. No shortcuts. Don’t rush—take your time, and do things right.”<br>
Mako loosened her bitten lip and whispered:<br>
“…Why?”<br>
Smiling gently, Sid looked straight into her eyes as the message closed.<br>
“And always, no matter what—believe in yourself. I believe in you.”<br>
“Liar!!”<br>
Mako screamed at the image of Sid.<br>
“Then why?! Why would you… I never asked for this!!”<br>
She ran over to Sid, who lay on the sofa, and reached for the SQ headset.<br>
“Don’t!! Mako!!”<br>
Emiko leapt and grabbed her hand just in time.<br>
“Force-stopping it is too dangerous. Please… calm down.”<br>
She gently pulled her daughter’s trembling hand away.<br>
Emiko’s body burned with fury.<br>—Not again. Not ever again… What the hell is everyone thinking? I won’t let Mako carry this kind of pain too.<br>
Dropping to her knees, she placed a hand on Mako’s shoulder, locking eyes with her tearful daughter.<br>
“Call him, Mako. Call Rou.”<br>
Mako’s eyes lit up. She jumped into her seat.<br>
“Papa! Help me…”<br>
She frantically opened a new terminal screen and typed in commands.<br>
“It’s not starting. Why!? Why won’t it work?! Papa!! There’s no time—Sid…!”<br>
Her whole body was shaking. Emiko took her trembling hand off the keyboard and said:<br>
“Mako. Listen to me.”<br>
“Look into his directory—Sid’s—on your machine.”<br>
“Huh…?”<br>
Emiko smiled into her daughter’s eyes.<br>
“You’ve always wanted to see it, haven’t you? The full architecture of the system he built. If anyone can understand what he intended—how it behaves—it’s you.”<br>
Mako looked between her mother and the display.<br>
“But… Mom, I…”<br>
Emiko smiled again and said:<br>
“Trust him. I believe the way to bring him back is in there. If you can locate the control point of the backflow, you can safely terminate the sequence.”<br>
Mako looked down at the keyboard, then up at the screen again.<br>
“Right… yeah. I just have to stop the system… safely.”<br>
Emiko nodded.<br>
“Yes. That’s it, Mako. And… have fun. No matter what.”<br>
Emiko held out her right hand. Mako pressed her tiny fist to it.<br>
“Okay, Mom. I’ll try.”<br>
Straightening her back, Mako placed her hands firmly on the keyboard.<br>
She inhaled… and then exhaled.<br>
[December 21, 2024 – 10:18 PM JST / 5:18 AM PST]<br>
▶ Time until lockdown release: 7 minutes 14 seconds<br>
Swallowing his overflowing emotions, Sidney gritted his teeth.<br>
“You dumb bastard… Always gotta be dramatic, even as a damn program… Dammit. Now I have to change the plan!”<br>
He glanced at the floating holographic interface, then swept his hand through it.<br>
The floating keys shimmered—and vanished.<br>
He took a deep breath, crossed his arms, and closed his eyes.<br>—I’m not done yet. I’m going to bring you back this time, Akira.<br>
He remembered the smile on Rou’s face—the one he couldn’t save—and slowly exhaled.<br>—There’s no time to build a new program… No time at all. Then…<br>
“I’ll write code into my own head and execute an emergency protocol here and now.”<br>
A swarm of data lines surged across Sidney’s brain.<br>
Akira’s recursive attention loop flooded into his thoughts, and a sharp, burning pain sliced through his mind.<br>—Shit… Focus. Hold on, Akira… to the loop, and to my code.<br>
“All right, Akira. First, I’ll anchor the center of your loop—make it faster, more efficient.”<br>—No delay allowed. I have to trigger Q1’s collapse and isolate Akira’s data flow—move it to a safe zone.<br>
In an instant, he visualized the entire structure of the sequence.<br>
His spirit surged with the rush of battle, sharpening his focus.<br>
Code blocks flowed through his mind, shifting, stacking, fixing into place.<br>
“Good.”<br>
Sidney smirked.<br>
“That’s right… Akira, you’re not alone. Watch me—this is my finest moment.”<br>
He opened his eyes, dropped his hands to his sides, and exhaled deeply.<br>
Then, placing two fingers from his left hand to his forehead, he closed his eyes and spoke:<br>
“Real-Time Failsafe Implementation—Start.”</p>
