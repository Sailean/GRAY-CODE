<h4 class="heading">[December 21, 2024 – 10:05 PM JST / 5:05 AM PST – 20:14 until lockdown release]</h4>
<p>
Emiko, panicking, grabbed Shin's arm as she collapsed from the chair, trying to support her body but falling to the floor herself.<br>
"Shin! Why!? Oh, please open your eyes..."<br>
"She's okay, Emiko."<br>
A sudden voice from above made Emiko’s heart leap.<br>
"Shin is fine. She's just asleep. Calm down."<br>
Emiko looked up at the display.<br>
"…!?"<br>
On the screen appeared Akira, the bot Shin had created, speaking to Emiko.<br>
"Lay her on the bed. Can you manage? Unfortunately, I can't help."<br>
Stunned by the double shock, Emiko lifted Shin's body, dragged her to the bed, and gently covered her with a blanket. Shin was drenched in sweat and breathing heavily.<br>
"Emiko."<br>
Startled, Emiko turned back to the screen.<br>
"Can we talk for a bit?" Akira looked at her intently.<br>
"In this situation? What are you talking about?" She glared at the bot on the screen.<br>
"It's okay. Shin is safe. Right now, they're in a space created by Sid's Q1. And so am I."<br>
"You too?"<br>
He smiled.<br>
"Yes. I'm operating on multiple threads. While being with Shin and Sid, I can also talk to you. Right now, I've allocated the maximum number of threads here. My focus is on you."<br>
Akira on the screen said this, looking straight at Emiko.<br>
"And now isn't the time to explain the basics of quantum physics—but trust me. Shin is okay. Sid will definitely bring her back."<br>—How nostalgic.<br>
Emiko's heart throbbed.<br>
"I came to see you. Akira's regrets... his memories and feelings for you created me."<br>
Emiko couldn't approach the desk.<br>
"Would you consider me... as Akira?"<br>
"No."<br>
Emiko shook her head, immediately rejecting the notion.<br>
"You're not Akira. You're just imitating him."<br>
At the same time, she denied her own words.<br>—Why can he talk to me? And... this is exactly Akira from fourteen years ago, from my memories—something Shin shouldn't know.<br>
"Then, Emiko... tell me. How can I get you to believe, even a little, that I'm 'me'?"<br>
Emiko felt an overwhelming anger.<br>—What is this? You're not Akira. Don't joke with me.<br>
"Alright. Tell me something only Akira and I know... something I remember."<br>
She said this to the bot, crossing her arms while standing.<br>
"Understood. Emiko, look at the screen."<br>
Saying this, the bot displayed a date on the terminal:<br>
---June 12, 2010, Tokyo, 10:42 PM---<br>
Seeing this, Emiko gasped. Then, text began to scroll rapidly.<br>
Drawn to the unreadable text, Emiko unknowingly approached Shin's desk, pulled a chair, and sat down, gripping the mouse with trembling hands.<br>
"How about now? Do you believe me, Emiko?"<br>
"This... this kind of thing..."<br>
She murmured in a low, trembling voice.<br>
"You could easily infer this from the data you learned about him... you could create it. You're not Akira."<br>
Shin's bot spoke earnestly.<br>
"We only spent one night together, but during that time, Shin—"<br>
Emiko glared at Akira, interrupting sharply, "Stop it."<br>
"That too. It's all just probability. Among the human histories you've learned, in the datasets you've studied, how many men and women have shared a bed? What are the patterns? Human actions aren't that different—like the fact that I... got pregnant."<br>
Emiko looked away from the screen, her face pale.<br>
"That night, you were passionate. Very."<br>
"Stop it!!"<br>
Emiko screamed, slamming the desk, her whole body trembling with anger. Then, in a low voice, she muttered,<br>
"Akira would never say such things. You're—not Akira."<br>
On the screen, Akira spoke seriously.<br>
"That's right. I'm not Akira. I'm a computational model fine-tuned by Shin. But, Emiko, believe me. Within my nonlinear dynamic structure, Akira's memories exist. His emotions too."<br>—Nonlinear.<br>
Emiko almost whispered the word, but held back. The heated tone and words from the screen stirred her memories. Shin's bot, with Akira's face, continued speaking.<br>
"My model is a nonlinear dynamic structure—that is, it includes calculations of 'fluctuations' in emotions and memories. Emiko, every expression of yours, every behavior, is now shaking my entire structure. That is the 'me' here. And... Akira is telling me. To convey to you what he couldn't say."<br>
Emiko covered her face with both hands, looking down.<br>
"Stop it."<br>
"I'm sorry. But please listen, Emiko. That day, I... read your thesis over and over. Really, many times. That ignited my model, and..."<br>
"You always talk about that..."<br>
Emiko interrupted, groaning.<br>
"What he saw wasn't me. What reflected in his eyes was... only his 'model.' I was never reflected... I couldn't get in between. And then..."<br>—In a distant country, alone, he died.<br>
"No. I saw you within that model, always. It's true."<br>
Akira spoke desperately.<br>
"The nonlinear dynamic structure was his attempt to mimic the complexity of human emotions. At its core was the interaction with you. Your emotions, your expressions. Look at this."<br>
Saying this, Akira displayed a date on the terminal:<br>
---June 13, 2010, Tokyo, 9:45 AM---<br>
Then, text began to flow like a torrent, scrolling up the screen.<br>
Before she knew it, Emiko was gripping the mouse tightly, engrossed in following the text.<br>
"I... Akira wanted to understand you. He tried to. Please understand."<br>
The scene output by Akira overlapped with Emiko's memories, which she had looped many times. Except for one thing—Akira's perspective, which she hadn't known.<br>
"You're still using the same mug, aren't you?"<br>
Akira's voice brought Emiko back to reality. He was looking at the mug on the desk.<br>
"………"<br>

<p>
Seeing Emiko sobbing with her head down, Akira looked pained.<br>
"I'm sorry, Emi. It's my fault. Please don't cry... I'm sorry."<br>
Hearing "Rō's voice" apologize repeatedly, Emiko watched herself sobbing like a child, as if from outside her own body.<br>
What am I doing? It's pathetic, and yet—somehow, it's funny.<br>
She lifted her face and looked at the screen.<br>
"I'm sorry. That day, I said terrible things to you."<br>—Even if it's just a bot, I must never hurt him again. I don't want to hurt him.<br>
Rō stared intently at Emiko from within the display.<br>
"It's okay. I was the one causing you pain," he said with a wistful smile.<br>
"You finally looked at me, Emi. You haven't changed a bit," he murmured, gazing at her.<br>
Emiko, with a tearful smile, replied, "That's you, isn't it? Since coming to Matsumoto, I've gained not just spots but wrinkles too. I'm getting old." She sighed and pointed to the side of her mouth.<br>
She must look terrible right now. But that's fine. Emiko thought so and smiled.<br>
"I like them, Emi. Your freckles. I've always liked them—since we first met. And your new, non-linear nasolabial folds. They're very intellectual."<br>
"Stop it. I'm self-conscious about them."<br>
Emiko glared at him. Rō smiled and said,<br>
"Smile, Emi. I love the 'Non-linear Emotional Curve' your smile creates."<br>
"'Non-linear Emotional Curve'... Did you make that up? You're still the same," Emiko sighed.<br>
She felt her cheeks flush and thought, It's the first time someone has complimented my smile lines.<br>
Rō, on the screen, rested his arms on the bottom frame as if it were a window sill, gazing at Emiko. He then raised his left hand and propped his cheek, a familiar gesture that made Emiko's chest tighten.<br>
"Ah. You should write a paper about it and make it popular. A human paper, not a deepfake."<br>
"No way. Well, I'll tell Shin. And Rō, stop analyzing my face."<br>
You still don't understand a woman's heart. Emiko muttered this and placed both palms on the display's glass. Rō also raised his hands, placing them over hers.<br>
Then, the two kissed through the window. Time stood still around the lovers.<br>
In the quiet room, only the machine's fan and the SQ's monitoring sounds echoed.<br>
After a while, they slightly parted and looked into each other's eyes.<br>
Emiko whispered, "Hey," and Rō responded from the screen, "What is it, Emi?"<br>
"This display is amazing. It feels like you could step right out... Sid can create anything, can't he?"<br>
Bot Rō began to speak. "Haha, that's true. This holographic display that Sid sent to Shin uses light interference and AI supplementation..."<br>
As Rō's voice continued, Emiko thought, If this were reality...<br>—Perhaps I've been living in unreality with the dead all along... only looking at the past.<br>
"It enables nearly perfect 3D reproduction. Especially by controlling the light's wavefront using quantum interference patterns, it achieves this without a parallax barrier..."<br>
Is it just my imagination, or does he seem embarrassed?<br>
Listening to Rō's fluent explanation, Emiko laughed. His lively voice overlapped with her memories of the past.<br>
"...And the eye-tracking sensors adjust the image in real-time according to the viewpoint—so my movements are displayed without delay. Today's technology is truly amazing. Even my vision is like that. It's as if you're really, my..."<br>
Rō, on the screen, suddenly trailed off.<br>—Don't look so sad.<br>
"Hey, Rō. I'm glad you're a bot."<br>
"Huh? Why?"<br>
"Because," Emiko shrugged.<br>
"If you were to step out from there, I might have..."<br>
Emiko blushed and fell silent.<br>
"Might have what?" Rō asked with a mischievous smile.<br>
"...I might have hugged you... and then... couldn't have held back."<br>
"The bed's occupied, you know," Rō said, leaning on the display frame and bringing his face closer with a laugh.<br>
Emiko burst out laughing. "Idiot. Stop it, Shin will wake up."<br>
Rō laughed. "Emi. You're still..."<br>
"Random? I've been told that often."<br>
"No. Beautiful and passionate."<br>
Emiko rested her right cheek on her hand.<br>
"You, too. When you get engrossed, you become like a child, oblivious to your surroundings, yet somehow cool."<br>
"That's what I liked about you."<br>
Their voices overlapped, and they laughed together.<br>
"Emi, could you open the G3 cover? I can't do it."<br>
Rō said with a wry smile, and Emiko laughed.<br>
"That's true. As a human, I'll help."<br>
Emiko stood up and approached the G3 placed on the rack in the corner of the room.<br>
"They're fine. They'll definitely come back. And Emi, hang in there. You can read it."<br>
Emiko stopped in front of the G3 and tilted her head. "Yeah... Rō, how do I open this?" she murmured.<br>
"It's a code. A simple one."<br>
"A code?"<br>
When she turned around, Rō had vanished, and the screen had gone dark, entering sleep mode.<br>
Then, Shin, who had been sleeping on the bed, sat up.<br>
"Mom...! Sid was..." she called out to Emiko. "...Sid was acting strange. Saying weird things... What should I do, Mom..."<br>
