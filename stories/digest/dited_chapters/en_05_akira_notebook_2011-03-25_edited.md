Chapter V: Akira’s Notebook
March 25, 2011 – Akira’s Family Home / Emiko Midorikawa

<p>Akira’s death—such a massive headline at the time—</p>
<p>is slowly fading from memory.</p>
<p>His death is being buried</p>
<p>among the countless others.</p>
<p>So many people…</p>
<p>have lost loved ones, children,</p>
<p>and many are still suffering, waiting,</p>
<p>never finding those they lost.</p>
<p>And now, as the whole world</p>
<p>looks upon our land with fear,</p>
<p>turns away from this country in dread—</p>
<p>He came.</p>
<p>His friend crossed the ocean to visit the village where Akira was born.</p>
<p>He had black hair. He was tall.</p>
<p>He wore a black sweater, black trousers, and black shoes.</p>
<p>“Emi, Akira’s belongings have finally been returned by the police. I’m sorry it took so long.”</p>
<p>He said this softly,</p>
<p>and pulled from the large bag on his shoulder</p>
<p>Akira’s notebook.</p>
<p>“I thought it shouldn’t be cleaned,”</p>
<p>“This is Akira’s DNA.”</p>
<p>I understood instantly.</p>
<p>Through the clear plastic bag, I held the notebook to my chest.</p>
<p>Akira had come home.</p>
<p>That’s what it felt like.</p>
<p>When I opened the bag,</p>
<p>the faint scent of burnt organic matter wafted out,</p>
<p>mingled with a trace of preservatives.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will carefully remove the pages,</p>
<p>photograph them, process them, and archive them.</p>
<p>The images will remain as data.</p>
<p>The deerskin cover I once gave him as a gift</p>
<p>is stained—deeply—</p>
<p>with soot, blood, and bodily fluids.</p>
<p>This notebook was protected by his skin.</p>
<p>Now, I will protect it.</p>
<p>When I began to cry,</p>
<p>with my belly round and full,</p>
<p>Sidney gently wrapped me in a hug.</p>
<p>Over and over, he said:</p>
<p>“Emi, I’m so sorry. I really am. Please, don’t cry, okay?”</p>
<p>And I replied:</p>
<p>“No, it’s not your fault. Really, I was happy you came.”</p>
<p>His cologne was subtly sweet,</p>
<p>and carried a gentle scent of cedar.</p>
