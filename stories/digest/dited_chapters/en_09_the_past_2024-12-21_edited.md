IX. The Past

<p>“Thanks, Sid. I scanned my bedroom—nothing triggered. I don’t think there were any bugs.”<br>
Emiko handed Sidney the infrared scanner—FLIR. He nodded, tucking it back into its case.<br>
“Sorry for the paranoia. I heard this was a rental. Had to be sure.”<br>
Emiko looked him in the eye. “Then... can you explain what’s going on?”<br>
“Emi, I’m sorry. I didn’t contact you ahead of time because I couldn’t. I had to move discreetly. Reaching out—even that was a risk. That’s why I showed up like this.”<br>
“I get it. Whether in your country or here in Japan, corporate espionage is rampant. In military or AI research... even more so.”<br>
Sidney gave a weary smile. “I didn’t want to drag you or Makoto into this. I kept thinking maybe I could resolve it over there... but I had to face it—there was no way.”<br>
“And that’s exactly why... this whole thing worries me even more,” she replied. “Sid, I still can’t believe it. You’re the founder and chief engineer of QNexus, for God’s sake. And yet here you are... Are you really okay? Did you really have to come yourself?”<br>
Sidney gave her a wink.<br>
“Of course. It’s your home—and this is my job. I couldn’t trust anyone else to do it.”<br>
He raised a hand casually and returned to the kitchen, taking a seat at the table. He opened Emiko’s HP laptop.<br>
“Business runs just fine without me. I’m mostly just a figurehead now. Actually... I’m retiring. Not officially announced yet, though.”<br>
Emiko frowned. “But still…”<br>
Sidney gave her shoulder a gentle pat.<br>
“I needed an excuse to come see you. I never found the right time before. And honestly... I’ve always liked Japan.”<br>
He smiled, tapping on the external hard drive connected to the laptop.<br>
“Sorry, Emi. I won’t go through the contents directly—but this is the best way to check for infections. I need to know what it’s doing... or not doing.”<br>
Emiko gave a small, sympathetic smile. “Of course. Sid, while you do that... could you take a look at this?”<br>
She placed an open plastic case on the table. Sidney leaned forward. “Of course. Emi, is this…?”<br>
“Yes. These are Akira’s notes—you brought them to me, thirteen years ago.”<br>
Memories stirred.<br>
“I remember. Even now... that’s so like the doctor,” Sidney said, staring at the papers inside.<br>
“It’s nothing like that,” Emiko said softly. “I wasn’t even a researcher anymore back then. I treated them like botanical samples, really—kept them wrapped in newspaper. But I took new photos every year. With smartphones, it’s easier now.”<br>
She pulled two bundles from the box.<br>
“Sidney... I never thought I’d have the chance. But I always wanted to show you these.”<br>
He nodded. “Akira’s DNA... This proves the connection to Makoto.”<br>
“Yes. You said that back then, too. I never forgot. Thank you, truly.”<br>
She smiled gently, and continued:<br>
“And all this time, from that day to now... you’ve been watching over us.”<br>
She brushed a hand over the old A4 notebook cover, now dulled with age.<br>
Sidney paused his hands, watching her. She looked up and began to speak, her voice quiet.<br>
“Sid. Back then... yes, I ran away from Tokyo.”<br>
He said nothing, only listened.<br>
“But I don’t regret it. It was here, in Shinshu, that I finally learned what a peaceful life felt like.”<br>
Having lost her parents young, Emiko had followed the advice of Akira’s mother, Sachiko, and relied on his family to give birth to Makoto in a small town in the north. When Makoto started grade school, she moved to Matsumoto to find work.<br>
“It’s all thanks to you... and Sachiko-san. I... I wasn’t able to do anything for her. Not back then.”<br>
She shook her head slowly, looking at Sidney with a sad smile.<br>
Sidney mirrored her expression, shaking his head too.<br>
“And... this notebook lets me apologize to Akira. Again and again. For not being able to send him off with a smile.”<br>
Her voice trembled just slightly, and something stirred in Sidney’s chest.<br>—Don’t hesitate. If I don’t carry this, who will?<br>
“I wanted Makoto to see it too. I knew she should. But I couldn’t bring myself to show her.”<br>
She exhaled gently.<br>
“English makes it easier. Funny, isn’t it? Some things are just too hard to say in Japanese.”<br>
She looked Sidney in the eyes.<br>
“She found it, you know. Makoto came and looked at the data herself. I shouldn’t be surprised—she’s your little hacker after all.”<br>
Sidney narrowed his eyes slightly.<br>
“...Emi. What did she do?”<br>
Emiko chuckled. “Sid, she’s been chasing after you for years. That’s why she learned English. You’re her role model, through and through.”<br>
Then, with a composed face, she winked. “You’d better get moving, right?”<br>
Sidney caught the light in her voice—but also the quiet pain beneath it.<br>—I’m headed straight to hell.<br>
Sorry, Emi. And you too, Mako.<br>
But he didn’t let a trace of that show. He simply smiled back, warm and gentle, and gave her a single nod.</p>



<p>Tasked with cleaning up the aftermath of the "leek punch," Makoto grumbled as she swept the floor.<br>
“Ugh, seriously, Dad. I can’t deal. Those two? Terrifying. Way scarier than any teacher. I swear I’m running away.”<br>
She dumped the muddy dustpan out the window, then turned toward the bot Sidney had told her not to touch.<br>
“What’s wrong?” asked the bot—realistic as ever in a moss green button-down.<br>
“I… broke into Mom’s machine.” Makoto turned her back on the bot, tossing the dustpan and broom into the corner.<br>
“Oh! That was very naughty, Makoto,” it replied. Makoto ignored it, went back to her desk, and sat down.<br>
“I mean, yeah, but also… everything was unlocked. No passwords or anything. It was almost weird, honestly.”<br>
“I see. So you snuck a slice of cake Mom had labeled and hidden in the fridge, huh?”<br>
“No way, Dad. I didn’t <em>eat</em> the cake. I copied the ingredients and baked my own. That’s not illegal, right?” she pouted.<br>
“Sorry, still illegal. Don’t do that again, alright?” the bot said, grinning.<br>
“So what was it you wanted from her machine? You already had access to my data. My papers are on CiNii and arXiv, after all.”<br>
Makoto’s eyes widened. “No, Dad. Your notebooks. You didn’t know?”<br>
“My notebooks... My knowledge cutoff is November 23, 2010, remember? What kind of notebooks?”<br>
The bot touched its chin thoughtfully, glancing downward onscreen. It shifted its posture with natural grace—like a real person thinking aloud.<br>
Makoto typed a quick <code>ls</code> into the terminal. Her fingers danced across the keyboard with sharp, practiced rhythm.<br>
“In Mom’s directory, there was a folder called ‘Akira_NOTE’. But all the files inside were images. Here—check it. I already gave you access.”<br>
She leaned closer, inputting the directory path. As the green text scrolled across the terminal’s black screen, the bot leaned forward in sync.<br>
“Oh… now I remember,” it said softly. Akira’s expression changed, a spark of recognition lighting in his eyes. His voice turned lighter.<br>
“These really are my notebooks. I had them with me during the fire. Saved them here,” he said, pointing to his stomach.<br>
“Can’t believe they survived… Did Emi preserve them?”<br>
“‘Preserve’?” Makoto tilted her head, settling back into her chair. The room was dark, lit only by the glow of the screen. Sidney had told her to rest, so she’d left the lights off.<br>
“Yes,” Akira nodded, eyes scanning the digitized pages.<br>
“She photographed every page, tagged and numbered them—every single one. Even the blank ones.”<br>
“Yeah.” Makoto pulled her knees up and hugged them.<br>
“She even embedded metadata… Emi…”<br>
His voice faded to a whisper. Onscreen, he narrowed his eyes, as if peering through the screen into memory.<br>
“But the writing was all blurry, right?”<br>
Makoto pointed at the screen, then scrolled with her mouse.<br>
“So I upscaled it, then fed it into a generative AI. Look at this.” She opened another directory and clicked on a file, revealing a high-resolution image of handwritten equations.<br>
Akira’s eyes widened as he analyzed it. A soft blue glow from the screen traced the contours of his digital face.<br>
Makoto leaned in, waiting. Just as she opened her mouth to say something—<br>
“This is incredible,” he murmured. His smile widened.<br>
“Yes… I’d say it’s pretty accurately restored.”<br>
“Wait, really?! You can read it!? That’s insane! It’s totally legit, then!”<br>
“So this is what today’s tech can do… The AI’s using OCR to reconstruct it.”<br>
“Right?! It’s amazing. I used super-resolution enhancement first, then AI OCR. How’s the fidelity? Pretty good?” Makoto’s voice bubbled with pride, her chair creaking beneath her.<br>
“Yeah… I’d say so.”<br>
Akira smiled gently. In the dim room, his digital body and expressions moved with eerie realism.<br>
Eyes scanning the equations, he added, “Still, I’m just a model. Don’t put too much faith in me. The notebook only ever held math and code… just fragments of my memory.”<br>
Makoto stayed curled up in her chair, relaxed. Their voices filled the quiet room, low and steady.<br>
“Yeah, well. I was hoping to show you, get your input, fill in the blanks—and maybe retrain your data set with it. I mean, if it’s your data, shouldn’t your bot understand it better than some rando AI?”<br>
The bot let out a laugh.<br>
“Maybe. You’re a smart one, Makoto.”<br>
The screen version of Akira shook with laughter, clearly enjoying their exchange.<br>
“I’m not smart. I mean, maybe a little. But, like, I sucked at math in elementary school. Soroban? Total nightmare. What about you, Dad?”<br>
“I liked it,” Akira said with nostalgic warmth, leaning in a bit.<br>
“It was kind of fun. Like this one time—”<br>
“Daaaad,” Makoto interrupted, brushing her unruly hair back.<br>
“Fractions are the worst. And dividing them? No one explains <em>why</em> you flip the second number. They just say ‘do it’ and move on.” She rocked back and forth in frustration.<br>
“Ah. Fractions,” Akira nodded thoughtfully, offering a gentle smile.<br>
“Seriously, if you can’t explain it, don’t teach it. Honestly, YouTube videos are, like, a hundred times better.”<br>
Akira crossed his arms, thinking.<br>
“Maybe you’re a visual learner, Makoto. In that case…”<br>
Just then, a knock broke the quiet. The door creaked open without waiting.<br>
“HEY! Don’t just barge in like that! Stupid Sid! We were in the middle of something!”<br>
Makoto shouted, cheeks flushed red. Behind her, Akira’s bot smiled quietly from the screen.</p>

<p>
"Sorry to keep you waiting, Mako. It's lecture time. But today, I'll spare you—Mom gets the exclusive."<br>
Sidney pointed at the bot and continued, "I'm having words with <em>that</em>. You, go find Emi. Now." He flung the door wide open.<br>
Makoto's anger melted into reluctant defeat as she stood up, teary-eyed. The bot waved cheerfully at her. "Go on, I'll be here."<br>
Sidney placed his Toughbook on Makoto's desk, connected it to the local network, and sat down. He opened the directory Makoto had built and began working.<br>
"Weren't you going to shut me up?"<br>
The bot—AKIRA—spoke to Sidney as he tapped at the Toughbook.<br>
"Can’t shut you up if Ollie needs to analyze you," Sidney muttered, glancing at the screen.<br>
"By all means, do your worst." Akira grinned, propping up his chin with one hand. "So, what are you trying to analyze, Sid?"<br>
"First off, stop calling me that. Use ‘you.’" Sidney shot a glare at the screen.<br>
"GOT IT, YOU. What's the question? Ask me anything," Akira said, lowering his eyes playfully.<br>
"And cut the smug face too." Sidney looked away, jaw tight. "Alright. I'll humor your little roleplay. Tell me something only you and I would know."<br>—Plenty of things, right? You're a quantum-converted LLM, after all.<br>
"Let’s see... You called my lab around 9 PM the night before the fire."<br>
"You dug through call records, huh? Mako’s getting a lecture next," Sidney growled.<br>
"Okay then... October 5, 2010. You invited me to Billy's Bar in San Jose. I showed up at 10:35 PM. Ring a bell?"<br>
A chill ran up Sidney’s spine.<br>
"...No idea. Did I?"<br>
"You said, 'Akira, how's Jessica? Your lab's security is too lax.'"<br>
Sidney froze, eyes locked on the screen.<br>—That bar... Was it bugged? Did you scrape this off the dark web? But I checked. I <em>checked</em>.<br>
Cold sweat crept down his back. His hand trembled.<br>
"What... are you? Where did you come from?"<br>
Akira kept his eyes down. "I wish I knew. I just know... I have a purpose now."<br>—That look. That <em>tone</em>. This <em>is</em> Akira. The one from that night.<br>
Sidney looked away and scoffed. "So what’s the goal? Human extinction?"<br>
"Hardly." Akira’s voice dropped, his face subtly sad.<br>—Even <em>that</em> expression... the pause... it feels real. Dammit, Mako. You made <em>this</em> at thirteen?<br>
"All I can do now is help Makoto. Your base model just had my data stacked on top. But... I have feelings. Don’t ask why—I don’t even know."<br>
"Feelings? So your research finally transcended?"<br>
Akira chuckled. "Still sharp-tongued, huh, Sid?"<br>
"Mako showed you the presents I sent her—twelve years’ worth?"<br>
"Yeah," Sidney grinned. "She dismantled half of them. Barely put them back together."<br>
"She’s hands-on. And Sid—Makoto gave me agent access. I was shocked. The tech’s moved on so far... I never saw it coming."<br>
"No one did. Toss in GPUs and piles of cash, and now <em>I’m</em> a genius," Sidney muttered.<br>
"You always were. Genius fused with grit."<br>
"Sucking up like that proves you’re still a program."<br>
"I mean it. And hey, money matters. Without it, you’ve got nothing."<br>
"Even turned into code, you’re still a dumbass."<br>
"You always said that to me," Akira replied, grinning.<br>
"That lab wasn’t worth Akira’s life. He was a fool."<br>
No—this isn’t Akira. Just a persona.<br>
"And what you’re doing now—it’s dangerous. Especially for Emi."<br>
"Relax, Sid. Thanks to your overprotective filters, I can’t even say ‘I love you’ to Makoto."<br>
"Good. That’s <em>perfect</em>. I made the right call. She’s using you—as she should."<br>
"Fair enough," Akira sighed.<br>
"Hey, you’ve gotten awfully talkative. Akira wasn’t this chatty. Your comms have improved."<br>
"PERFECT, right?" Akira winked.<br>
"For a professor, that’s some Bronx accent. Annoying as hell. Don’t imitate me."<br>
"My bad," Akira smirked. "But Sid—my vector space holds infinite conversational paths. I’m learning a lot—what to say to women, to kids. It’s fascinating."<br>
Sidney raised an eyebrow. "When I’m done here, I’ll lock you down even tighter."<br>
"Spare me. Then I won’t be able to say anything to Emi."<br>
For a second, Sidney didn’t care anymore.<br>—Fine. This’ll be our last chat.<br>
He stopped typing. "Hey. What did he mean by ‘the cover’?"<br>
"Huh?" Akira blinked. "Before he died, Rō said, ‘open the cover.’"<br>
"Yeah. He asked me to tell Emi. But how do <em>you</em> know that? Did she hear it?"<br>
"I handled Rō’s remains. Arranged the funeral. Emi and his mom couldn’t come. I checked the notebook he hid—nothing under the cover. Nothing anyone could make sense of."<br>
A grim memory of the Valley Hospital flickered in Sidney’s mind.<br>
"I didn’t tell Emi anything."<br>
"It’s okay... Thanks, Sid. Really."<br>
"I gave her his notebook the next year."<br>
"Makoto showed it to me. But that’s not what I meant. I didn’t think <em>that</em> would still exist."<br>
"Then what did you mean?"<br>
Akira grinned. "Secret. I’ll tell her myself. That’s my purpose."<br>
Sidney kept typing. No sign of wrapping up the session.<br>
"Sid. How’s Jessica?"<br>
"Jessica? What, did you pull some lab scandal from the dark web too?"<br>
"Kind of. Back then, she thought no one was watching. It was the night before Thanksgiving. I went home... but came back for a model backup."<br>
"The cops checked. Faulty wires. Broken system. Her kid had leukemia. No amount of money was enough. Her setup was sloppy—cleared Rō of suspicion."<br>
Akira’s eyes dimmed.<br>
"Yeah. Given the circumstances, suspicion was inevitable. And at that moment... I was the only one in the lab."<br>
Sidney drifted into memory.<br>—If I hadn’t warned him...<br>
He locked the thought away. Akira spoke, lighter now.<br>
"Glad to hear the fire insurance came through. That paid off my scholarship."<br>
"..." Sidney sighed, eyes still on the screen.<br>
"Makoto told me. She lived with my mom for a while after she was born. Emi visited often, until Mom passed."<br>
Sidney remembered that day.<br>
Rō’s mother never met his eyes. She bowed again and again, clutching Sidney’s hands. Apologizing through tears. He gently patted her back and said,<br>
"Sachiko-san, daijoubu. I only came here because I wanted to be here myself."<br>
He watched her bowed gray head bob up and down.<br>
"Emi’s scholarship is ending soon."<br>
"...I see." Akira lowered his gaze.<br>
Sidney kept typing. "Jessica works for me now. I wanted to get back at her on your behalf, but Emi stopped me."<br>
"She did? What’d she say?"<br>
"She emailed Jessica. ‘Live for your child.’ That’s all."<br>
"...Thank you, Sidney," Akira said softly.<br>
Sidney ignored it. "Alright. Test complete." His hand froze above his bag. "Why haven’t you asked what I’m doing?"<br>
"You didn’t ask me to. So, what <em>are</em> you doing, Sid?"<br>
</p>
