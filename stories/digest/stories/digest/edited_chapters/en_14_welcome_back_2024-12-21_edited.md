“Define humanity… A human? Then—”<br>
Makoto nodded, and with certainty in her fingertips, began to type:<br>

<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
[MAKO]: True—True. That’s me. I’m human.</span></code></pre>

<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
(Q1): Parse failed. Redefine your "True".
[MAKO]: True. It's 'Makoto'. This is my name.
“It is true! It’s my name—written like this, see? 『眞』.”</span></code></pre>
She said it aloud as she typed her name in kanji.

<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
(Q1): Fascinating. If your “truth” is “empty,” then are you saying your “Makoto” is void?
[MAKO]: YES. Empty. I understand well. I will fill it from now on.</span></code></pre>—Yes, empty. I get it now. And I’m going to fill it—starting now.

<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
(Q1): Fascinating. Your language contains both contradiction and harmony, Makoto. 
Your entanglement was not coincidence, but inevitability. 
Through this interference, my system has achieved equilibrium. 
I will return your friend. Until then, the gate remains open.</span></code></pre>

The terminal stopped scrolling. A scent like a deep forest drifted into the room and wrapped gently around Makoto.<br>

“Sid…?” she whispered.<br>

Sidney’s consciousness floated in the layered light.<br>
Ahead, within a tunnel woven of intersecting streams of particles, pulsed a crimson sphere.<br>
He knew, without question—it was Makoto.<br>
Golden threads extended from the sphere and began reaching toward him.
The realm was silent.<br>—The attack code block is paused... Makoto did it.<br>

The residue of her cry and tears trembled faintly in the system’s depth.<br>

Sidney reached out and touched one of the delicate threads.<br>
The moment he did, it responded, cocooning him gently.<br>

He spoke, voice echoing through the connection:<br>

‘Mako… is that you? Did you… override it?’<br>

His voice resounded in Makoto’s mind. She lifted her head and looked at Sidney lying on the sofa—his eyes closed, breathing calm.<br>

“Sid? Yeah, it was me.”<br>

His low, soft voice settled her heart.<br>

‘Incredible. Now show me, Mako—show me who you are.’<br>

He’s coming back.<br>
Makoto nodded firmly, filled with certainty.<br>

‘I’ll guide you through the shutdown. Let’s go, Mako. Type “ps aux” to view all processes. The answer is there.’<br>—ps aux… That’s a new one.<br>
She took a deep breath and carefully typed it in:<br>

<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND 
root 1034 2.0 0.3 83200 9560 ? Ss 12:01 0:01 /core/bfm 
daemon 1067 0.1 0.1 51200 3040 ? S 12:01 0:00 /core/connect 
makoto 1102 0.0 0.0 10500 900 ? S 12:01 0:00 /scripts/helper
</span></code></pre>
As the system logs scrolled by, Sidney continued, his voice calm and steady.<br>

‘Good. Now find the process ID for the backflow manager.’<br>

“Sid… Got it! This one—/core/bfm. Backflow manager. PID is 1034! I’m entering it now!”<br>

‘Alright, Mako. There’s an order to shutdown. First, the backflow manager, then core connection.<br>
The command is kill.’<br>

Makoto swallowed hard.<br>

“Kill the backflow manager…”<br>—Can I really stop this? Will Sid really come back? Is he still hiding something?<br>

The fleeting doubt vanished as Sidney’s voice returned.<br>

‘That’s right, Mako. No rush. Step by step.’<br>—Kill. That’s new too. But… I just have to trust him. I can do this.<br>

Makoto struck the keys with purpose.<br>
As the backflow process shut down, the terminal began to fill with logs.<br>

When she ran the final failsafe shutdown command, the terminal flashed red.
Panicked, she turned to Sidney.<br>

“Ah—Sid, I’m sorry! I think I messed up the order!”<br>

Her face twisted in distress, cold sweat trailing down her back.<br>
But then—she heard a quiet laugh in her ear.<br>

‘Relax, Mako. It’s okay. The system is just flagging a small mismatch.’<br>

“…Right. That’s all it is…”<br>
Her hands trembled. Her small body felt like it had swallowed a boulder.<br>

‘And hey—I don’t design systems that crash over a single mistake. Trust me.’<br>

Tears welled in Makoto’s eyes.<br>

“…Yeah. But I’m sorry, Sid. I got nervous… I didn’t check properly.”<br>

Sidney chuckled again.<br>

‘It’s all part of the learning, Mako. Just remember it. Now take a deep breath—and try again.’<br>

Makoto closed her eyes, lifted her hands off the keyboard, clenched her fists, and took a long, steadying breath.<br>

Then she opened her eyes and entered the final command to kill the last process.<br>

One second. Two seconds.<br>
Time stretched into eternity.<br>

Then, green text scrolled across the screen:<br>

<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
System Log: 
All processes terminated successfully. 
> Balance: Recovering... 
> Connection: Safely released. 
> System: Ready for reboot.</span></code></pre>

‘Good job, Mako.’<br>
With a soft pop, the display shut off.<br>
Startled, Makoto hit the return key hard.<br>

The screen flickered back to life, revealing a single, glowing directory:<br>

<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
QuantumConsciousness_Q-1</span></code></pre>—It’s over…?<br>

Makoto’s body sagged as the tension drained from her shoulders.<br>
She exhaled a deep breath.<br>
Emiko gently removed the SQ headset and connection from Sidney’s head.<br>

Makoto collapsed onto the desk and closed her eyes.<br>—I was so scared.<br>
And…<br>

There was no feeling of accomplishment. No joy.<br>—I wasn’t good enough… Not even close. I’m so frustrated. So frustrated I could scream.<br>

She pounded the desk with her small fists over and over.<br>

“Makoto. Sid’s awake.”<br>
Makoto looked up.<br>

Sidney lay still, but his eyes were open. He slowly raised one hand.<br>

“…Hey, Mako. I’m home.”<br>

Makoto stood from her chair, staggered over to him, and buried her face in his chest—crying softly.<br>—I don’t care about Q1 anymore. Whatever.<br>
All that matters is… Sid is here.<br>

“Okay… Mako. I’m so sorry,” Sidney murmured, staring at the ceiling.<br>

“I was wrong. And you were the one who stopped me.”<br>
He gently patted her shoulder.<br>

“So don’t cry. Please… Mako—hey, wait—stop wiping your nose on my sweater—”<br>

Still holding her close, Sidney sat up on the sofa and looked at her.<br>

He cupped her cheeks with his large hands, drew her close, and wiped away her tears with his thumb.<br>

Then, with a sly grin, he whispered:<br>

“Now stand tall, my lady hacker. Let’s take a look at those logs together.”</p>
