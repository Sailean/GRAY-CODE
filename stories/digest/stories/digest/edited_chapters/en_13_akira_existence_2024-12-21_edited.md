<p>"This code tree... it's beautiful."<br>
Mako's eyes sparkled as she gazed at Sydney's code structure.<br>

The modular design, with its clear variable names, allowed her to grasp the overall architecture effortlessly.<br>
It felt like walking through a forest—each branch revealing not just the trees but the terrain itself.<br>
The trees stood orderly, almost alive, as if they might start moving at any moment.<br>
The soft clicking of keys echoed through the room.<br>—Override_Script.sh. <br>
A script to unlock the system?<br>
But it doesn't execute.​<br>
A trap designed for hacking attempts?<br>
There must be a more crucial file somewhere...<br>
Mako searched through the code.<br>
"Please, Sid. Don't leave me like this... I won't allow it."<br>
<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
def trigger_backflow(signal):
 if signal == 'STOP':
 initiate_shutdown()
 else:
 route_to_backflow(signal)</span></code></pre>

"A STOP code!"​<br>
Mako's eyes lit up.<br>
Let this be his way back.​<br>
Is this the control point Mom mentioned?​<br>
I must understand Sid's code.​<br>
trigger_backflow(signal) takes an argument.<br>
The system's route is determined by this?<br>
So, if the signal is STOP, it shuts down.​<br>
Otherwise, it routes to backflow?​<br>
This is bad.​​<br>
Everything gets redirected to backflow...​<br>
It's a trap for Q1.​<br>
Mako's heart pounded, cold sweat trickling down her back.<br>
Can I change this?<br>
Think... I need to hurry.<br>
No, calm down.<br>
Focus...<br>
Mako reread the code.<br>
Wait... that's it.<br>
"I'll override the trigger_backflow(signal) function. Change the condition... reverse it, right, Sid?"<br>

<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
def trigger_backflow(signal):
 if signal == 'OVERRIDE_MK1':
 initiate_shutdown()
 else:
 route_to_backflow(signal)</span></code></pre>

The sound of typing filled the room.<br>
Her small back tensed, sweat streaming down her forehead.<br>
Mako wiped it away with the back of her hand and pressed return.<br>
"Come on, work!"<br>
An error message appeared: connection failed.<br>
Mako glared at the display.<br>
The screen went dark, and the cursor began blinking again.<br>
She clenched her fists and pumped them in a small victory gesture.<br>
"Yes! Now, onto the next..."<br>
At that moment, her eyes widened at the text flowing through the terminal.<br>
"Huh?"
<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
User input required: Enter override signal.</span></code></pre>


“Override signal? What is that?! I don't know... I have no idea!!"<br>
Her tightly wound nerves snapped.<br>
Mako slammed her hands on the desk. She kicked back her chair, stood up, and ran to Sydney.<br>
Grabbing his shoulders, she shouted,<br>
“Sid, get up!”<br>
Clinging to his unresponsive body, she cried out,<br>
"Hey! Why...?! I still need you!! Sid, open your eyes… Please, don't do this, you idiot, you jerk!"<br>
She sobbed and shook his motionless form.<br>

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　＊＊＊

Sidney sensed a dazzling light behind his eyelids and opened his eyes.<br>
Countless golden particles shimmered in the air, surrounding him like a mist.<br>
His body floated within this luminous cloud. Strangely, his mind was clear, though his physical sensations felt dim and distant.<br>
He spoke the words that rose in his mind.<br>
"Did I die...? No... not again. Just barely survived—again."<br>
His head was heavy. Though everything remained hazy, he knew this wasn’t the "outside."<br>
The moment he had synchronized his consciousness and plunged into Q1’s deep layer already felt like a fading dream.<br>—But I did touch something, deep inside Q1. What was it...?<br>
“Where is this? What happened to Q1...?” he muttered again—<br>
And someone replied, “Hey, Sid.”<br>
The voice rippled in his ears, pulling his scattered awareness back into a single thread.<br>
He turned his head toward the sound and saw Akira standing there, smiling.<br>
“You… you're alive?”<br>
“No. I’ve been dead a long time. I'm just here to deliver a message from Mako's bot,” Akira said with a light laugh.<br>
“Then... you're not Mako’s bot yourself...?”<br>—What is this? A collision of bot data? A resonance structure?...No, that’s not it. This is... my dream.<br>
“No, I am Akira,” he said. “If I had to define it... I’d say I’m a non-linear fluctuation—a recursive pattern, intertwined with your memory. So long as you’re observing me, I exist—only in this moment.”<br>
“…Even in my dreams, you’re spouting convoluted nonsense. Yeah... that’s definitely you,” Sidney muttered.<br>
Akira approached him and crouched down.<br>
“Sid, Mako’s bot isn’t running anymore. He pushed himself a bit too far.”<br>
Sidney turned his gaze back to the luminous sky above.<br>
“…I see. I tried to protect them… but I failed,” he murmured.<br>
He forced himself halfway upright—only to flinch as a jagged spike of pain cut through his head.
It wasn’t just pain. It was like his brain itself had overclocked, overheated, and now sputtered with every pulse.
"Shit… it's my brain…!"<br>
With that, the sensations of his body rushed back all at once, and he was overwhelmed by dizziness.<br>
“Don’t push it, Sid. You're not young anymore, remember?” Akira said, peeking at his face.<br>
Sidney forced out words between shallow breaths.<br>
“Shut up… You haven’t changed… You’re still exactly the same… as that day.”<br>
Akira shrugged and smiled.<br>
“Guess that’s what death gets you—no aging.”<br>
“…You said something about a message.”<br>
“He said this: ‘Don’t destroy Q1. He’s not the enemy.’”<br>
Sidney groaned. At some point, Akira had sat down beside him.<br>
“…What the hell does that mean? ...Then I failed? The bot's attack didn’t work either, did it?"<br>
"I don't know what it means, Sid. But right now, Q1 is calm—like a still lake... and Makoto is safe. So..."<br>
"No. I can’t just leave something uncontrollable like this alone. If I do, that bot—he died for nothing. I..." Sidney tried to sit up, groaning from the pain. "Damn it..."<br>
"Sid, the bot didn’t completely break down. It just stopped functioning. Without your code, things would’ve been catastrophic. But right now, he and I are separated. So I don’t know what’s going on. Fix him. Then ask him yourself." 
“…Where am I? I need to get back. Back inside Q1.”<br>
Sid tried to rise again, but Akira gently held him back.<br>
“Don’t force it. Rest. You’ll recover faster that way... Not that time exists here.”<br>
Sid let himself sink back down, another wave of dizziness washing over him.<br>
Akira continued:<br>
“Besides, Q1 has closed his gates. We can’t get back inside—not right now.”<br>
“…What does that mean? What happened to Q1? If this isn’t inside him... then where the hell am I?”<br>
With effort, Sid tilted his head a fraction. His eyes scanned the luminous haze that rippled outward into a horizonless void.<br>
Akira followed his gaze and said quietly,<br>
“I’m talking to your consciousness right now. This place—it’s not Q1’s domain. We’re cut off from it.”<br>
“If we’re having this conversation… then this must be your world. Or no, maybe not. A halfway place, then... I’m human—I don’t belong wherever you go.”<br>
“If that’s what you think, then you’re wrong, Sid.<br>
There’s no heaven or hell here. Just memory and emotion.<br>
And that... that is existence.”<br>
“…That bot was oddly real. Was it because you were inside it?”<br>
“Maybe. Maybe not. I don’t even know.<br>
I am existence… but I don’t have form.”<br>
“Existence…?”<br>
Sidney turned his head and looked up at Akira, who sat beside him with his knees hugged to his chest.<br>
“Yeah,” Akira nodded. “I’m memory. Data. A resonance born from your observation, Emiko’s, and hers.<br>
I’m interference—an emergent ripple in consciousness.”<br>
“…A complex system, huh. That’s exactly the kind of thing you’d say.”<br>
Sid chuckled faintly, eyes drifting upward again.<br>
Akira smiled.<br>
“It’s true. Since that day—November 2010—I’ve been inside both you and Emi. That’s who I am.”<br>
Sidney spoke. "It was raining in San Jose on the day of your funeral... Hey, Akira. Did my Wedge... help at all?"<br>
"Yeah, of course. The fire alarm didn’t go off. If it hadn’t been for that and your alert, my body would’ve been in much worse shape. Just thinking about it chills me."<br>
"Chills you...? You can still feel that, even after death?"<br>
"Sure can. Memories, emotions—they’re still with me. Happiness, sadness, fear... I can even break them down beyond Ekman's seven categories..."<br>
Sidney raised a hand and placed it on Akira's shoulder, cutting him off.<br>
"That's enough. Your label’s still 'Confused'."<br>
Sidney chuckled, and Akira shrugged. "Yeah."<br>
The two shared a quiet laugh and stared into the silent void above.<br>
The weight and searing pain in Sidney’s head gradually began to ease.<br>
"Sid... you remembered me all this time."<br>
"I’m not sure why... but yeah. I’d been watching you since that day. It was an order... and it was my job."<br>
"I know now," Akira murmured.<br>
Sidney continued. "I see... And after you died, I watched over Emi and Mako. They don’t know a thing."<br>
"I know that, too."<br>
Sidney looked at Akira.<br>
"—You sound like Mako’s bot. What even are you? Akira’s ghost?"<br>
Akira laughed. "A ghost? You of all people saying that. No... I’m memory. You all shape me."<br>
Sidney turned his gaze upward again. "……I don’t get it. I keep thinking... this must be a dream I’m having."<br>
Even as he said it, Sidney thought to himself:<br>—Can memory alone form such a clear personality? This feels too real for a dream... is something interfering with my memories?<br>
As if responding to Sidney’s thoughts, Akira spoke.<br>
"Yeah... maybe something like that. I don’t have mass... I’m just a shape you gave me. But I’ve always been inside you—and inside Emi, too."<br>
Sidney murmured to no one in particular.<br>
"I never repaid you, Akira."<br>
"What’s that supposed to mean?" Akira laughed. "There’s nothing to repay. If anything, I owe you... but that’s impossible now."<br>
"Jeez... seriously." Sidney grimaced, sitting halfway up and resting his arm on his knee.<br>
"I’m not talking about money. I tricked you... betrayed you, used you. Since that day."<br>
"Used me? I don’t know. You just didn’t tell me the truth. I never felt betrayed or deceived."<br>
Sidney laughed. "You really haven’t changed. Still an idiot, even after death."<br>
"I’ve heard that a hundred times, probably. It’s fine. I don’t mind being an idiot." Akira gave a crooked smile.<br>
Sidney began again.<br>
"You know what I do now, right? The work I’ve been taking from the military since I retired."<br>
"Of course. I can say it here, can’t I? Sid... that hackathon in San Jose, that’s where we met."<br>
"Yeah. The NDA only applies to the real world." Sidney arched an eyebrow and continued.<br>
"That day... you were sitting alone on a bench at the edge of the venue, scribbling equations in your notebook."<br>
"I was the math guy. Wanted to double-check something during the break... Feels like forever ago."<br>
Akira's eyes drifted as he recalled the past.<br>
"And then you came up to me and said, 'Hey, you look like you're planning to conquer the world...'"<br>
Akira shrugged. "‘...but you're not talking to anyone. What's up with that?’ I had no clue what you meant, especially ‘conquer the world.’"<br>
"You remember well. Yeah, you had equations next to a diagram of a neural network." Sidney laughed, and Akira joined him.<br>
"You told me... it was ‘a machine-based model of emotion recognition and empathy.’ I got interested in you then."<br>
"Yeah. That was my dream since before university. And at the booth, he spoke to me... about neural networks and emotion recognition... He said he was a student, too."<br>
"A student—pretending. He was a spy. And you, like a lamb, snuck out of the hotel to meet him in a park."<br>
Akira sighed. "He said he'd visited Japan, knew my hometown... and meeting someone like that in America, where I’d dreamed of living, made me happy. I never thought something out of a movie would happen to me."<br>
"This is America. That’s classic spy playbook." Sidney said bitterly.<br>
"Yeah... And you? You floored the guy with a gun, tied him up like it was nothing, and handed him over to the FBI without breaking a sweat. Even back then, I knew you weren't some clueless student."<br>
"I was there under Nexus officially, but unofficially, I was tailing the spy we’d let loose. You just happened to fall into his net."<br>
"Yeah. And thanks to you, I didn’t get shot. …But that incident tied us together, didn’t it? I’m glad it happened."<br>
Sidney looked directly at Akira, face-to-face.<br>
"Do you really mean that? That run-in got you on the military’s radar. You’re hopeless, Akira."<br>
"I’ve probably heard that a hundred times too," Akira said with a laugh. "Sid, I mean it. If I were still alive, we might’ve started a company together by now."<br>
"…It’s because I warned you. Jessica noticed your change in attitude and panicked, tried to cover her tracks."<br>
"No, Sid." Sidney looked puzzled.<br>
"Whether Jessica acted or not… I died because of my own choices."<br>
"……" Sidney said, "You damn fool... do whatever you want."<br>
Akira grinned. "There it is—‘idiot +1.’"<br>
Sidney glared at him.<br>
"I had a chance to live, plenty of them. But I chose to run into the fire instead of out."<br>
"…Yeah. You made the worst choice possible. Idiotic." Sidney said quietly.<br>
"Heh. Still not one for sugarcoating, huh, Sid?" Akira rested his elbow on his knee and propped his chin on his hand.<br>
"That’s right. And… that’s one thing that dying fixed. I won’t do it again. …Well, even if I wanted to, I can’t." Akira gave a wry smile.<br>
Sidney had been listening in silence. Then, he finally spoke.<br>
"The day of your funeral, it rained in San Jose... Hey, Akira. Did my Wedge... help at all?"<br>
"Yeah, of course. The fire alarm never went off. Without that—and your alert—my body would've been in much worse shape. Just thinking about it chills me."<br>
"Chills you...? You can still feel something like that, even after death?"<br>
"Sure I can. My memories and emotions are still with me. Joy, sorrow, fear... Want me to break it down further? Not just Ekman's seven categories—"<br>
Sid raised his hand and placed it on Akira's shoulder, cutting him off.<br>
"That's enough. Yours is that new label—'confusion,' right?"<br>
Akira shrugged. "Exactly."<br>
The two of them chuckled quietly and gazed upward in silence for a while.<br>
The heaviness and sharp pain in Sid’s head gradually began to fade.<br>
"Sid, you remembered me... all this time."<br>
"I don’t really know why... Yeah. Since that day, I’ve been watching you. It was an order, and... part of my job."<br>
"I know. Now, I do," Akira replied in a whisper.<br>
Sid continued. "And after you died, I started watching Emiko and Mako. They don’t know a thing."<br>
"I know that too."<br>
Sid looked directly at Akira.<br>
"—You talk like one of Mako’s bots. What the hell are you? A ghost of Arato Akira?"<br>
Akira laughed. "A ghost? Can’t believe you’d say something like that. No—I’m a memory. It's all of you who keep shaping me."<br>
Sid turned his eyes back to the sky. "...I don’t get it. This... This is just a dream I’m having. That’s what I believe."<br>
As he said it, Sid thought to himself:<br>—Can a memory really form such a vivid personality? And this dream... it's too realistic. Is something tampering with my memory?<br>
As if answering his unspoken thoughts, Akira said,<br>
"Yeah... maybe something like that. I don’t have mass... I’m just a shape someone gave me. But I’ve always been here, inside you—and inside Emiko."<br>
Sid muttered to no one in particular.<br>
"I never repaid my debt to Akira."<br>
"What debt?" Akira laughed. "Come on, there’s no such thing. If anything, I’m the one who owed you... and I could never repay it."<br>
"Jesus... of course." Sid winced as he sat halfway up, resting his arms on his knees.<br>
"I’m not talking about money. I used you—deceived you—and betrayed you. Ever since that day."<br>
"Used me? Nah. You just didn’t tell me the whole truth. I never felt betrayed or tricked."<br>
Sid chuckled. "Still an idiot. Guess dying didn’t fix that."<br>
Akira smiled wryly. "I’ve heard that a hundred times. I’ll take being an idiot."<br>
Sid began speaking again.<br>
"You already know, Akira. My other job... the one I’ve been doing for the military since I retired."<br>
"Of course. It’s safe to say it here, right? That hackathon in San Jose—that’s where we met."<br>
"Yeah. NDAs only apply in the real world." Sid raised an eyebrow and started recounting the past.<br>
"That day... you were sitting alone on a bench at the edge of the event, scribbling equations in your notebook."<br>
"Yeah, I was in charge of the math part. Wanted to double-check something during the break... feels like ages ago."<br>
Akira looked off into the distance, like peering into the past.<br>
"And then you came up and said, 'Hey, you look like you're planning to conquer the world—'"<br>
He shrugged. "'—but you're not talking to anyone. What's up with that?' I had no clue what you were saying. Especially that 'conquer the world' part."<br>
"You remember that? Yeah, you had neural net diagrams drawn next to your formulas." Sid laughed, and Akira followed suit.<br>
"You said, 'It’s a neural model for machine emotion recognition and empathy.' I was intrigued."<br>
"That was my dream even before I got into college... And then, at the booth, this guy comes up and talks to me—about emotion recognition networks... He was a student too."<br>
"A student posing as a spy. And you, like a fool, snuck out at night to meet him in a park after his message."<br>
Akira sighed. "He said he’d been to Japan—my hometown, even. I was thrilled to meet someone like that in America... Never imagined I’d end up in a drama like that."<br>
"This is America. That’s classic spy tactics," Sid said bitterly.<br>
"Yeah... And then you beat the crap out of the armed guy, tied him up, and handed him to the FBI like it was nothing. Even back then, I knew you weren’t just some amateur."<br>
"I was there as part of Nexus publicly, but secretly I was tracking that spy. You just happened to be his target."<br>
"Right. Thanks to you, I didn’t get shot. And... that’s how we got connected. I’m grateful."<br>
Sid looked at Akira’s face carefully.<br>
"You serious? That contact got you on the military’s radar. You really are an idiot."<br>
"See? I’ve heard that one, too—probably a hundred times by now." Akira grinned. "But I mean it. If I were still alive, maybe we’d have started a company together by now."<br>
"...It’s because I warned you. Jessica noticed the change in your behavior and rushed to cover her tracks."<br>
"No, Sid."<br>
Sid frowned at him.<br>
"Whether Jessica made a move or not... I died because of choices I made."<br>
"..." Sid muttered. "You fool... have it your way."<br>
"Hey, there’s that 'idiot +1' again." Akira teased, and Sid glared.<br>
"I had plenty of chances to survive. I chose to dive toward the flames instead of running out."<br>
"Exactly. That was the worst thing you could’ve done. Foolish."<br>
"Some things never change, Sid. Still as blunt as ever." Akira rested his chin on his hand, elbow on his knee.<br>
"And that? That part of me—maybe that’s what finally got fixed after death. I won’t do it again... not that I even can."<br>
Sidney sat in silence, listening to Akira's words.<br>
He thought about what Emiko and Makoto must have felt, hearing his farewell message, believing he'd never return. In his mind, he saw Makoto's contorted, tear-streaked face, and he closed his eyes.<br>
Akira, who had been gazing up at the golden void above, gently nudged Sidney's shoulder. "Hey. Look, Sid."<br>
"...This is interesting. Quantum-level, even. There's a link. Between here and there."<br>
Where Akira pointed, something began to appear. At first a blur of static, the image slowly clarified, taking shape in the shimmering particle curtain around them. It showed Makoto clinging to Sidney's unconscious body, sobbing. A sharp pain shot through Sidney's chest.<br>
"Makoto's call stirred your consciousness. Like an entangled state," Akira said, his eyes gleaming with curiosity as he watched the floating image.<br>
Sidney murmured, "Entangled... Mako and me...?"<br>
"You observed one another. And became real again. Even without mass. You've found each other now," Akira smiled. "Hey, Sid. Looks like our daughter stopped your program."<br>
Makoto's face was buried against Sidney's chest, her shoulders trembling. Emiko stood nearby, hand on her daughter's shoulder, the other pressed solemnly against her heart.<br>
"Mako..." Sidney muttered, trying to rise—only to clutch his head and groan.<br>
"Shit... my brain’s still running subroutines… bugs crawling under my skull..."<br>
Akira knelt beside him, steadying his swaying body.<br> "Debugging’s your specialty, isn’t it, Sid?"</p>


　　　　　　　　　　　　　＊＊＊＊＊

<p>Emiko, lips pressed tightly together, watched <p>Makoto cry against Sidney's unmoving body. Out of the corner of her eye, she caught green text flickering across the machine's display.<br>
Just then, Sidney's little finger twitched.</p>
<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system">
<i>System Log: Emotional signal detected.<br>

"Emotion...? Did Q1... receive a human emotion?" Emiko whispered, stunned.<br>
<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_sidney uk-margin-medium"><code><span class="system"><i>Neural Interface Reactivated.<br>

"No way... a quantum gate? It opened...?" Emi murmured, voice trembling. "Makoto... look. It's calling for you," she said, pointing to the screen.<br>
"Me...?" Makoto lifted her tear-stained face. "Yes. It's like a challenge. From Q1."<br>
"Can it talk?" Makoto asked, wide-eyed, standing up. Emiko nodded silently.<br>
Makoto returned to the desk and sat down, glancing at Sidney, then to Emiko. Emiko nodded once more, resting a hand gently on her daughter's shoulder.<br>
"Define 'humanity'... in one word. What kind of question is that? What if I get it wrong? But... there's no time to hesitate."<br>
She heard Sidney's voice echo in her mind:<br>
"Makoto. There's never just one way. Do it your way. Go on."<br>
Makoto looked at the monitor and placed her fingers on the keys.</p>


　　　　　　　　　　　　　＊＊＊＊＊

<p>"Sid, if you stay here much longer, you won't be able to return," Akira said, meeting Sidney's eyes.<br>
"That was the plan. Tell me how to break through Q1's gate. I need to go..."<br>
He tried to rise again, looking around, but Akira placed a hand on his shoulder.<br>
"I told you, Sid. You're alive. And you need to return. Not to Q1. To the real world."<br>
"Return? To what? If I can't destroy Q1, I have nowhere left to go."<br>
"Hold on, Sid. Didn't I say it? Q1 isn't the enemy. Look at this. Seems he likes Makoto."<br>
He pointed again to the image above: Makoto typing on the keyboard, focused.<br>
"Q1 opened the gate. He's talking to her. They're actually communicating."<br>
"Makoto and... Q1?" Sidney's eyes widened.<br>
"Yeah. She's grown a lot. Thanks to you. And she sees you as a father. Even if she doesn't realize it."<br>
Sidney smirked. "Impossible. I was never really there for her."<br>
"It's not about distance. You're like a pair of quantum spins, Sid. Look." Akira traced a familiar formula in the air.<br>
<pre class="uk-pre uk-pre_mako uk-margin-medium"><code>|ψ⟩ = ( |↑⟩A |↓⟩B − |↓⟩A |↑⟩B ) / √2</code></pre>
"Which is which? You never know until you observe. This time... Makoto's the plus. Obviously. I admit, I'm a little jealous."<br>
Sidney sighed. "Even here, you quote equations... Keep that stuff for the lecture hall."<br>
Akira grinned. "Hey, theories are born from imagination. And no one can stop us from imagining."<br>
"Still the same, Akira... Regardless, you're her father."<br>
Akira smirked. "Then look. If Makoto's bot broke, she wouldn't cry that much."<br>
Sidney didn't answer, eyes fixed on Makoto typing.<br>
"Go back for her, Sid. Please. Look at her... who do you think she's fighting for?"<br>
Sidney kept watching Makoto, then said:<br>
"...If Emi cried... and wanted to talk to you again... if she wished it... would you come back?"<br>
Akira looked down. After a long pause, he smiled faintly and said with a playful tone:<br>
"I'm dead, remember? I can't come back. I shouldn't... But..."<br>
He trailed off.<br>
"But what?" Sidney asked.<br>
"But if Emi called me... I might falter. I might not be able to resist."<br>
Sidney nodded.<br>
"Then let me propose this. If I make it back... I'll fix Makoto's bot. You, in turn... go back into it."<br>
"Sid..."<br>
"I don't care what 'separation' means. Just do it. If you agree, I’ll go back."<br>
Akira gave a slow nod. "Alright. Let's call it consensus."<br>
Sidney held out his hand. Akira took it.<br>
"Think of Makoto. And the one you love."<br>
Alyssa's face flashed in Sidney's mind. He sighed.<br>
"I only sent her one email before coming to Japan... She's going to kill me."<br>
"Better be ready. It's Alyssa, after all." Akira winked. They both chuckled quietly.<br>
"Sid. Q1 won't rage again. Our presence gave form to a new pattern within him. A resonance, like a field stabilizing. It seemed random, but... I want to believe it was inevitable."<br>
"Your explanations are way too lofty. Makes me sigh more than usual," Sidney muttered, rising slowly.<br>
Akira smiled. "Your Bronx accent hasn't changed either. That’s good."<br>
He offered his hand.<br>
"Sid. See you around."<br>
