シドニー in 1998 Krymsk
イリーナとシドニー

# Chapter 1: Mission Briefing

**Langley, Virginia — 1999, Late Fall**

Sidney Grayson, 27, sat in the shadow of the overhead projector’s hum. The room smelled of burnt coffee and warm circuits. DIA briefing center, lower level — no windows, no clocks, and no bullshit.

"This is her," the handler said flatly, tossing a glossy 4x6 onto the desk.

A woman — black hair, porcelain skin, ambiguous expression. File codename: Red Vixen.

"We call her the red fox. Don’t get clever with the name — she’s not red and she’s no one’s pet."

Sid flipped the photo over. Handwritten note: *Confirmed FSB asset. Operates through cultural diplomacy fronts.*

"You’ll be embedded in Krymsk, Southern Russia. Cover: telecom infrastructure consulting. In reality, you’re there to intercept encrypted packet streams from a decommissioned bioweapons facility. There’s a digital ghost in the lines — we want to know what it is and who’s feeding it."

"And her?"

"Your in. Or your noose."

## Chapter 2: Arrival in Krymsk

**Krymsk, Russia — December 1999**

A gray town rimmed by frost-bitten forest. Rusted train cars lined the outskirts like corpses in a forgotten war. The air was cold enough to crystalize breath. Sidney arrived under his alias: Daniel Shore, senior engineer at an American-European telecom joint venture.

The hotel was Soviet vintage: concrete, peeling floral wallpaper, heat that groaned through copper pipes. He carried a briefcase with a laptop, a stack of forged documentation, and several classified components disguised as modems.

Officially, he was modernizing outdated infrastructure. Unofficially, he was here to wiretap a ghost network — transmissions using old Soviet shortwave channels, embedded in military-grade shielding.

He set up shop in a repurposed communications outpost on the edge of town. Locals avoided it. That helped. Every evening, he logged encrypted code fragments and reconstructed partial keys. Something — someone — was still using the network.

## Chapter 3: First Contact

They met at a local New Year’s coordination committee — a thin excuse for Western and Russian entities to pretend diplomacy over vodka and stale pastries. She introduced herself as Irina Mikhailova, regional cultural liaison. Accent: practiced. Smile: effortless. Eyes: surgical.

He knew the moment she sat across from him. This was the fox.

She leaned forward. "You’re very quiet, Mr. Shore. Not a fan of pirozhki?"

He smiled thinly. "I’m more of a systems man than a social one."

"Mm. Then I suppose we’ll get along. I like quiet men."

That night, he returned to his room and typed two lines into the secure field report:

*Subject confirmed. Pattern matches asset profile. Caution advised — subject may already suspect cover.*

## Chapter 4: The Slow Dance

Over the weeks, they ran into each other at diplomatic functions, infrastructure walkthroughs, a suspiciously frequent series of planning meetings she always happened to attend.

She would ask about his work. He would give half-answers, enough to appear normal, but vague enough to trigger counter-surveillance analysis.

Then came the night she "forgot her gloves" in the meeting room. Sid retrieved them and walked them back. She invited him in.

There were no bugs he could detect — he’d checked twice.

She poured two fingers of vodka, sat far too close on the couch, and murmured:

"What’s your real name?"

He didn't flinch. "You first."

She laughed. Then silence. Then —

She kissed him.

He didn’t stop her.

## Chapter 5: The First Night in the Snow

It was snowing when he left her apartment that night — or early morning. The flakes fell sideways under yellow streetlamps, and his breath came out in clouds he could have sworn spelled her name.

But the real night came two days later.

She came to his door without knocking. A black wool coat, snow dusting her shoulders. No makeup. No pretense.

He let her in.

She didn’t speak. Instead, she pulled off her gloves, one finger at a time, and placed them neatly on his desk. Then she stepped into the center of the room.

"Tell me you’re not armed."

"I’m not."

"Then take this from me."

She pulled a folded piece of paper from her coat pocket — printed in cyrillic, official seal, an internal lab memo.

He took it without looking. He placed it on the desk, face down.

"You didn’t read it."

"It’s not the thing I want most in this room."

She looked at him like he’d said something dangerous. Then — slowly — she unbuttoned the coat. Underneath, a thermal undershirt, tucked into jeans. Practical. Not seductive.

"You’re sure you’re not recording this?"

"Positive."

"Good. Because I’m not either."

The heat between them wasn’t explosive. It was slow, quiet, like embers igniting dry wood. They undressed each other like people who didn’t want to startle anything. The bed was too small, and the room too cold, but she climbed over him with a softness he didn’t expect.

Halfway through, she whispered, "You’re not supposed to matter."

He didn’t answer. He kissed the words off her throat instead.

She trembled once, but didn’t cry.

And when they lay still afterward, her head on his chest, she said:

"You’ll leave this place before I do. Remember me warm. Not the snow."

He didn’t know what that meant.

But he would.

## Chapter 6: The First Real Trade

Three nights later, she came again. This time without a coat.

"You said you wanted the truth," she said. "So here."

A sealed envelope. Inside: detailed rosters, schematics of a nearby facility that didn’t officially exist, schedule logs marked in two types of handwriting.

"Half of this could get you killed," he said, frowning.

"Half of it is already outdated," she replied. "But you’ll know which half isn’t."

He did. She was right.

He placed it in the safe, then turned back to her. "Why now?"

Irina hesitated — only slightly — then shrugged. "Maybe I want out. Maybe I want to see if you’d believe me. Maybe I’m tired."

He watched her. She sat on the edge of his desk, legs crossed, hands flat against the surface. Unarmed. Open. A trap?

Possibly. But something in her eyes was different tonight. Less steel. More shadow.

"If I asked you to come back with me," he said, "to the States — what would you say?"

She tilted her head, curious. "I’d say you were still too young to know how this ends."

And then she kissed him again, but this time slower. Not as a move. Not as bait. It felt like someone saying goodbye before they’d decided to leave.

## Chapter 7: The Last Night Before Goodbye

That night, she stayed. Not with urgency, but with something like resolution.

He pulled her to the bed as if it were the only safe place left. She climbed into his lap, straddling him, and kissed him until neither of them remembered what started it.

He didn’t notice the pinprick in the condom foil.

She held him tighter than usual. As if memorizing his skin. His breath. The weight of his body.

"I would’ve gone with you," she whispered, after, still curled against his chest. "If the world were different."

He buried his face in her hair. "It still can be. I’ll find a way."

She didn’t answer. Only kissed his collarbone like she was already mourning it.

And when he fell asleep, she stared at the ceiling and said nothing.

She had already chosen.




ソ連崩壊後の余波で揺れる1990年代末
ドラマの【静かな激震】──アメリカは入手したイリーナ・ファイルで隠れた通信塔の所在を知る→ghost relayミッションへ繋ぐ

✅ シドニー in 1998 Krymsk：任務中ステータス整理
ミッション目標：ロシア某スリーパーセルと接触、通信網の設計図／人脈リストの奪取（イリーナが所持）

事前想定：情報は拷問または心理戦で引き出す／できればターゲットも確保

流れ：イリーナはある晩、シドニーに自らファイルを差し出した。

報告書に書かれた内容：
「情報はターゲットから自発的に得られた。交戦なし。確保は失敗」
→ 上層部：「口説いて落とした。まあいい。成功とみなす」
→ シド：「……（何も言えない）」

補足：
イリーナは命を狙われる。情報を渡したことで、彼女は“用済み”としてどちらの陣営からも追われる立場に。

🕯️ シドのミッションはイリーナが去った後もまだ終わらず。帰国前夜、再び彼女が現れる──
地点：ノヴォロシースク港近郊。雪が残るトラックヤードの影。
時刻：日没後。シド、任務報告と帰国準備のため最後の移動中。

🎬 別れから３ヶ月後の再会シーン草稿
雪が音を吸っていた。
薄闇の中、鉄の匂いが風に混ざる。
「……シドニー」
声を聞いた瞬間、彼は振り返らなかった。
「そのまま、歩き続けて、振り返らないで。巻いた、尾がいる」
その早口の囁きは、震えていた。
「私……妊娠した。あなたの子」
シドニーは一瞬凍りつき、再び歩き出す。彼の右後ろから小さな囁きが耳に届く。
「この情報をあなたに渡すか，私は迷った。でも……ごめんなさい、シドニー。それだけ、最後に言いたかった」

シドニーは思わず振り向いた。
そこには僅かな通行人と、降りしきる雪に埋もれていく小さな足跡が残るだけだった。

この後、イリーナを追っていたロシア側スパイとアメリカ側スパイが交戦し、イリーナをアメリカ側が守ってカナダに亡命させる。結果的にアメリカはイリーナの情報をほぼ全て確保できた。
子供の父親がシドニーであることはマーラがもみ消し、上には報告されない。シドニーはイリーナが死んだと聞かされる。
