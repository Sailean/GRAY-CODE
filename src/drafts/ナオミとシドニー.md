      Naomi breathless after climbing the ladder: “Hey… Little Man, why do you even know about this place…?”<br>
      Sidney (laughs): “Used to come here when I needed to run.”<br>
      Naomi: “You know… I always called you Tiny…”<br>
      Sidney: “Hmm?”<br>
      Naomi: “…maybe I’m the tiny one now.”

Sid: "...Does it hurt?"
Naomi (smiling too quickly): "No, I'm fine… really."
Sid (pauses): "You're not fine, are you."
Naomi: "..."
Sid (pulls away): "Sorry. I can't."
Naomi: "Why?"
Sid (laughs softly): "You look like you're hurting. And… I'm already out of commission."
Naomi: "Out of—what?"
Sid: "My son retreated."
Naomi (bursts into laughter): "You're ridiculous. But sweet."
Sid: "I'm serious."

      Later, Sidney whispers: “I couldn’t protect you then, Naomi. But I’ll learn. I’ll train. I’ll become strong enough so you never have to flinch again.”<br>
      <em>He doesn’t yet realize… it’s this very vow that will cost him the life they dream of.</em>
